NLP-Project
===========
Members: Anas Salamah, Jordan Hoskins, Nick Farrow

Project Proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x34VXmbU3Hr0deV65aqz5kN6jJbPxMDYg72f9zURHZw/edit?usp=sharing

TODO List
===========

* I think a good starting point is to go over hw4 and change our criteria for classifying documents to match what we talked about in the proposal and that should give us the question type(what type of thing the question is asking for)

* [NICK] read training/test files, and extract the question sentences, and return the clean sentences.
(sentences returned as a python list, no period exists at end of sentence, all lowercase letters)

* [NICK] write code to evaluate the QANTA and IR_Wiki guessers performance

* [NICK] create an initial guess (solution file) based on the top computer guesses only.
no sentence information will be used for this initial guess.
