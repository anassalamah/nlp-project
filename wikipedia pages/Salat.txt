Ṣalāt ("prayer", or case#Arabic|]: ; pl. ) is the practice of formal worship in Islam. Its importance for Muslims is indicated by its status as one of the Five Pillars of Islam. 

Salat is preceded by ritual ablution and usually performed five times a day. It consists of the repetition of a unit called a rakʿah (pl. rakaʿāt) consisting of prescribed actions and words. The number of obligatory (fard) rakaʿāt varies from two to four according to the time of day or other circumstances (such as Friday congregational worship, which has two rakats). Prayer is obligatory for all Muslims except those who are disabled, prepubescent, very sick, lactating, pregnant, menstruating, frail and elderly or travelling on a long journey. Multicultural Handbook of Food, Nutrition and Dietetics, p. 43, Aruna Thaker, Arlene Barton, 2012 Roughly 49% of Muslims pray their daily prayers regularly.

==Various views==
Under the Hanbali School of thought, a person who doesn't pray 5 times a day is an unbeliever. The other three Sunni schools of thought say that the person who doesn't pray five times a day is just an unholy sinner. Those who prescribe to the Hanbali view cite a hadith from Sahih Muslim that states that prayer is a dividing line between a believer and a non-believer.

For Muslims of the Sunni and Mustaali Ismaili persuasions obligatory salat is prescribed at five periods of the day. These are measured according to the movement of the sun. These are: near dawn (fajr), after midday has passed and the sun starts to tilt downwards / Noon (zuhr or ẓuhr), in the afternoon (asr), just after sunset (maghrib) and around nightfall (Isha). Under some circumstances ritual worship can be shortened or combined (according to prescribed procedures). In case a ritual worship is not performed at the right time, it must be performed later. Muslim doctrine permits ẓuhr (, "noon") and ʿaṣr (, "afternoon") prayers to be performed in succession. http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Religion/?id=1.0.1409142549 Muslim cultures today: a reference guide By Kathryn M. Coughlin, page 91 

==Terminology==
Salat (ṣalāh) is an Arabic word whose basic meaning is "bowing, homage, worship, prayer". In its English usage, the reference of the word is almost always confined to the Muslim formal, obligatory worship described in this article.

Translating salat as "prayer" is not usually considered precise enough, as "prayer" can indicate several different ways of relating to God; personal prayer or supplication is called dua (literally "call") in Islamic usage.

Muslims themselves use several terms to refer to salat depending on their language or culture. In many parts of the world, including many non-Arab countries such as Indonesia, the Arabic term salat is used. The other major term is the Persian word namāz (), used by speakers of the Indo-Iranian languages (e.g., Persian, Urdu), as well as Turkish, Russian (in an Islamic context), Chinese, Bosnian and Albanian.

==Purpose and importance==

The chief purpose of salat is to act as a person's communication with and remembrance of God. By reciting "The Opening", the first sura (chapter) of the Quran, as required in all daily worship, the worshipper can stand before God, thank and praise him, and to ask for guidance along the "Straight Path".

In addition, daily worship reminds Muslims to give thanks for God's blessings and that submission to God takes precedence over all other concerns, thereby revolving their life around God and submitting to his will. Worship also serves as a formal method of dhikr or remembering Allah. 

In the Quran, it is written that: "For, Believers are those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a tremor in their hearts, and when they hear His signs rehearsed, find their faith strengthened, and put (all) their trust in their Lord;" 

"To those whose hearts, when God is mentioned, are filled with fear, who show patient perseverance over their afflictions, keep up regular prayer, and spend (in charity) out of what we have bestowed upon them." 

Salat is also cited as a means of restraining a believer from social wrongs and moral deviancy. 

According to a hadith in the collection Sahih Bukhari, Muhammad considered salat "the best deed".

People who find it physically difficult can perform Salat in a way suitable for them. To perform valid Salat, Muslims must be in a state of ritual purity, which is mainly achieved by ritual ablution, (wuḍūʾ), according to prescribed procedures.

==Differences in practice==
Shi'a Muslims funeral prayers in Iran
The Islamic worship practiced by one Muslim may differ from another's in minor details, which can affect the precise actions and words involved. Differences arise because of different interpretations of the Islamic legal sources by the different schools of law (madhhabs) in Sunni Islam, and by different legal traditions within Shia'ism. In the case of ritual worship these differences are generally minor, and do not necessarily cause dispute. Muslims believe that Muhammad practiced, taught, and disseminated the worship ritual in the whole community of Muslims and made it part of their life. The practice has, therefore, been concurrently and perpetually practiced by the community in each of the generations. The authority for the basic forms of the Salat is neither the hadiths nor the Qur'an, but rather the consensus of Muslims. Al-Mawrid Differences also occur due to optional (recommended rather than obligatory) articles of prayer procedure, for example, which verses of the Quran to recite.

Shia Muslims, after the end of the prayer, raise their hands three times, reciting Allah hu akbar and Sunnis just look at the left and right shoulder saying salams. Also Shias in the second Rakak often read "Qunoot", which for Sunnis is often done after salat.

* are Muslim
* are of sound mind
* have reached the age of puberty (beginning at age seven is recommended). 

Elements that make salat valid: 
* Confidence of the time of worship. http://www.al-islam.org/laws/invalidate.html 
* Facing the qibla, with the chest facing the direction of the Kaaba. The ill and the old are allowed leniency with posture.
* Covering the awrah Amr ʻAbd al-Munʻim Salīm, Important lessons for Muslim women, Darussalam, 2005, page 174 
* Clean clothes, body, place of prostration.
* Ritual purity (wudu, tayammum, ghusl)
* Praying in front of a sutrah Questions and Answers on the Sutrah, by Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen is recommended.

The place of worship should be clean. In a few cases where blood is leaving the body, salat is forbidden until a later time. Women are not allowed to pray during their menses and for a period after childbirth. Sahih Bukhari 1.6.301 See also : "... and call in to witness from among your men two witnesses; but if there are not two men, then one man and two women from among those whom you choose to be witnesses, so that if one of the two errs, the second of the two may remind the other...." Women In Islam Versus Women In The Judaeo-Christian Tradition 

==Preparation==

===Cleanliness and dress===
Islam advises that salat be performed in a ritually clean environment. When worshipping, the clothes that are worn and the place of prayer must be clean. Both men and women are required to cover their bodies (awrah) in reasonably loose-fitting garments. The well-known adage or hadith by al-Nawawi that "purity is half the faith" An-Nawawi's Forty Hadiths illustrates how Islam has incorporated and modified existing rules of purity in its religious system.

===Ritual ablution===

Before conducting salat, a Muslim has to perform a ritual ablution. The minor ablution is performed using water (wudu), or sand (tayammum) when water is unavailable or not advisable to use for reasons such as illness.
Wuhu is performed by Muslims according to the instructions of God given in the Quran:

More specifically, wudu is performed by Muslims by washing the hands, mouth, nose, arms, face, hair(often washing the hair is merely drawing the already wet hands from the fringe to the nape of the neck), ears, and feet three times each in that order. (It is not obligatory to wash the hair three times, once is sufficient, and men must also wash their beard and mustache when washing the face).

===Intention===

The person should be conscious and aware of the particular salat that is being offered, whether it is obligatory, if it is a missed (qadha) worship, performed individually or among the congregation, a shortened traveller's worship etc. The explicit verbalization of this intention is not required. The person should think his worship to be the Last Worship so that he may perform the best he can.

==How to conduct salat==

A Muslim raises his hands to recite Takbeeratul-Ihram in prayer
Important positions during salat.

A Muslim turns his head towards the right performing the Taslim, marking the end of his prayers.
Each salat is made up of a repeating unit or cycle called a rakat. The number of rakats for the five daily worship can be found below.

In each of the positions, the Muslim usually needs to consider these, which may vary between schools and gender :
* Position of legs and feet.
* Position of hands, including fingers
* Place where eyes should focus
* The minimum amount of adhkar/recitation, depending upon whether the worshipper is Imam or following the Imam or praying alone.
* Loudness of recitation : audible, or moving of lips, or just listening

A basic rakat is made up of these parts.

===Standing===

* If this is the first rakat, the prayer is commenced by the saying of the takbir, which is الله أَكْبَر (transliteration "allāhu 'akbar", meaning God is Greater). The hands are raised level with shoulders or level with top of the ears, with fingers apart and not spaced out or together. This is done before, with or after the takbir. One who wants to show respect will hold their hands there for about a few 5 extra seconds extending the takbir. For the able-bodied, leaning or not standing upright invalidates prayer. For those who are not able to, they can perform salat while sitting down (in case of illness or any situation like traveling in a vehicle, on a horse, etc), while lying down (in case of illness) and even with indication. 
* Both arms are placed over the chest, with the right arm over the left.
* If this is the first rakat, a supplication praising God is said such as سُبْحَانَكَ اللّٰھُمَّ وَ بِحَمدِکَ وَ تَبَارَکَ اسمُکَ وَ تَعَالٰی جَدُّکَ وَ لَا ِالٰہَ غَیرُک Subhaanak-Allaahumma, wa bihamdika, wa tabaarakasmuka, wa ta'aalaa jadduka, wa laa ilaaha ghayruka.
* Muslims then ask refuge with Allah from the accursed devil from such as acūdhu bi-llāhi min ash-shayṭāni r-rajīm.
* The recitation of the Quran begins with b-ism illāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīm.
* Surah Al-Fatiha is recited.
* If this is the first or second rakat, the recitation of Al-Fatiha is followed with a recitation from any other section from the Quran of choice.
* The takbir is said again and the hands are raised as previously described and the next position, ruku', begins.

At-tahiyyatu lillahi wa 's-salawatu wa 't-tayyibatu as-salamu `alayka ayyuha'n-nabiyyu wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh as-salamu `alayna wa `ala `ibadillahi's-saliheen ashadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan `abduhu wa rasuluh.
All the salutations, prayers and good things are for Allah. Peace be on you O Prophet, and the blessings of Allah, and His grace. Peace on us and on all the righteous servants of Allah.

In the last rakat one concludes the prayers with Salawat Ibrahimiyyah:

اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ اللَّهُمَّ بَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ، وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ

==Prayer in congregation==

Women's prayer hall in Khadija Mosque, Berlin
Prayer in congregation (jama'ah) is considered to have more social and spiritual benefit than praying by oneself. When praying in congregation, the people stand in straight parallel rows behind the chosen imam, facing qibla. The imam, who leads the congregation in salat, is usually chosen to be a scholar or the one who has the best knowledge of the Qur'an, preferably someone who has memorised it (a hafiz) . In the first row behind the imam, if available, would be another hafiz to correct the imam in case a mistake is made during the performance of the salat. The prayer is performed as normal, with the congregation following the actions and movements of the imam as he performs the salat.

Upon entering the mosque, "Tahiyyatul masjid" may be performed; this is to pay respects to the mosque. Every Muslim entering the mosque is encouraged to perform these two rakats.

When the worshippers consist of men and women combined, a man is chosen as the imam. In this situation, women are typically forbidden from performing this role. This point, though unanimously agreed on by the major schools of Islam, is disputed by some groups, based partly on a hadith whose interpretation is controversial. When the congregation consists entirely of women and pre-pubescent children, one woman is chosen as imam.

When men, women, and children are praying, the children's rows are usually between the men's and women's rows, with the men at the front and women at the back. Another configuration is where the men's and women's rows are side by side, separated by a curtain or other barrier, with the primary intention being for there to be no direct line of sight between male and female worshippers, following a Qur'anic injunction toward men and women each lowering their gazes (Qur'an 24:30–31).

==Types of prayers==
Prayers may be classified into four categories of obligation: fard, wajib, sunnah, and nafl. "Understanding Salat" from Albalagh 

===Fard As-salat===
The fard as-salat are the five compulsory daily prayers, the Friday prayer (jumu'ah), and the funeral prayer (janazah). Nonperformance of fard as-salat renders one a non-Muslim according to the Hanbali Sunni School, while for the other Sunni schools it renders one a sinner. The denial of its compulsory status, however, is agreed upon by all Sunni schools to render the denier outside the fold of Islam. Fard prayers (as with all fard actions) are further classed as fard al-ayn (obligation of the self) and fard al-kifayah (obligation of sufficiency). Fard al-ayn are those actions that are obligatory on each individual; he or she will be held to account if the actions are not performed. Fard al-kifayah are actions obligatory on the Muslim community at large, so that if some people within the community carry it out no Muslim is considered blameworthy, but if no one carries it out all incur a collective punishment.

Men are required to perform the fard salat in congregation (jama'ah), behind an imam when they are able. According to most Islamic scholars, performing prayers in congregation is mustahabb(recommended) for men, http://www.al-islam.org/laws/jamaatprayers.html when they are able, but is neither required nor forbidden for women.

====The five daily prayers====
Display showing prayer times in a Turkish mosque.
I. Fajr, II. Zuhr, III. Asr, IV. Maghrib, V. Isha
Muslims are commanded to perform prayers five times a day. These prayers are obligatory on every Muslim who has reached the age of puberty, with the exception being those who are mentally ill, too physically ill for it to be possible, menstruating, or experiencing postnatal bleeding. Those who are ill or otherwise physically unable to offer their prayers in the traditional form are permitted to offer their prayers while sitting or lying, as they are able. The five prayers are each assigned to certain prescribed times (al waqt) at which they must be performed, unless there is a compelling reason for not being able to perform them on time.

Some Muslims offer voluntary prayers (sunna rawatib) immediately before and after the prescribed fard prayers. Sunni Muslims classify these prayers as sunnah, while Shi'ah consider them nafil. The number of rakats for each of the five obligatory prayers as well as the voluntary prayers (before and after) are listed below:

 Name Prescribed time period (waqt) Voluntary before fard1 Obligatory Voluntary after fard1 
 Sunni Shi'a Sunni Shi'a 
 Fajr (فجر) Dawn to sunrise, should be read at least 10–15 minutes before sunrise 2 Rakats Sunnat-Mu'akkadah 2 Rakats 2 Rakats — 2 Rakats 
 Zuhr (ظهر) After true noon until Asr 4 Rakats Sunnat-Mu'akkadah 4 Rakats 4 Rakats 2 Rakats Sunnat-Mu'akkadah 8 Rakats 
 Asr (عصر) Afternoon 4 Rakats Sunnat-Ghair-Mu'akkdah 4 Rakats 4 Rakats - 8 Rakats 
 Maghrib (مغرب) After sunset until dusk 2 Rakats Sunnat-Ghair-Mu'akkdah 3 Rakats 3 Rakats 2 Rakats Sunnat-Mu'akkadah 2 Rakats 
 Isha (عشاء) Dusk until dawn it is makrooh to pray Isha after midnight 4 Rakats Sunnat-Ghair-Mu'akkadah 4 Rakats 4 Rakats 2 Rakats Sunnat-Mu'akkadah,3 Rakats Witr 2 Rakats 

Sunni Muslims also perform two rakats nafl (voluntary) after the Zuhr and Maghrib prayers. During the Isha prayer, they perform the two rakats nafl after the two Sunnat-Mu'akkadah and after the witr prayer.

: According to Shia Muslims, these are to be performed in sets of two rakats each. This is not the case for Sunni Muslims.
: According to Sunni Muslims, there is a difference between Sunnat-Mu'akkadah (obligatory) and Sunnat-Ghair-Mu'akkadah (voluntary). Unlike for the Sunnat-Ghair-Mu'akkadah, the Sunnat-Mu'akkadah was prayed by Muhammed daily.
: Mustahab (praiseworthy) to do everyday. (Shias)
: Replaced by Jumu'ah on Fridays, which consists of two rakats.
: According to Imam Abu Hanifa, "Asr starts when the shadow of an object becomes twice its height (plus the length of its shadow at the start time of Zuhr)." For the rest of Imams, "Asr starts when the shadow of an object becomes equal to its length (plus the length of its shadow at the start time of Zuhr)." Asr ends as the sun begins to set.
: According to Shia Muslims, Asr prayer and Isha prayer have no set times but are performed from mid-day. Zuhr and Asr prayers must be performed before sunset, and the time for Asr prayer starts after Zuhr has been performed. Maghrib and Isha prayers must be performed before midnight, and the time for Isha prayer can start after Maghrib has been performed, as long as no more light remains in the western sky signifying the arrival of the true night.
: According to Shia Muslims, this prayer is termed nawafil.
: Further information on the usage of the word "Isha" (evening) see:. 

====Jumu'ah====

Jumu'ah at Kaohsiung Mosque, Taiwan.
Salat al-Jumu'ah is a congregational prayer on Friday, which replaces the Zuhr prayer. It is compulsory upon men to perform it in congregation, while women may perform it so or may perform Zuhr salat instead. Salat al-Jumu'ah consists of a sermon (khutba) given by the speaker (khatib) after which two rakats are performed. There is no Salat al-Jumu'ah without a khutba.

===Wajib salat===
Wajib As-salat are compulsory, non-performance of which renders one a sinner. However, the evidence of the obligation is open to interpretation, with some of the madhab saying it is obligatory while others saying it is optional. To deny that a fard salat is obligatory is an act of disbelief while denying the obligation of a wajib salat is not disbelief. There are some who believe that as the 5 prayers are obligatory, it automatically renders all other prayers optional.

===Sunnah salat===

Sun'nah sal'ah are optional and were additional voluntary prayers performed by Muhammad — they are of two types http://www.classicalislamgroup.com/viewpage.php?page=381 — the Sun'nah Mukkaddah, those practiced on a regular basis, which if abandoned cause the abandoner to be regarded as sinful by the Hanafi School and the Sun'nah Ghair Mukkaddah, those practiced on a semi-regular practice by Prophet Muhammad about which all are that their abandonment doesn't render one sinful.

Certain sunnah prayers have prescribed waqts associated with them. Those ordained for before each of the fard prayers must be performed between the first call to prayer (adhan) and the second call (iqama), which signifies the start of the fard prayer. http://islamqa.info/en/ref/33779 Those sunnah ordained for after the fard prayers can be performed any time between the end of the fard prayers and the end of the current prayer's waqt. Any amount of extra rakats may be offered, but most madha'ib prescribe a certain number of rakats for each sunnah salat.

===Nafl salat===

Nafl salat (supererogatory prayers) are voluntary, and one may offer as many as he or she likes almost any time. http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.com/prayers.htm There are many specific conditions or situations when one may wish to offer nafl prayers. They cannot be offered at sunrise, true noon, or sunset. http://wn.com/namaz The prohibition against salat at these times is to prevent the practice of sun worship.

====Salat-al-Witr====

Witr is performed after the salat of Isha (dusk). Some Muslims consider witr wajib while others consider it optional. It may contain any odd number of rakats from one to eleven according to the different schools of jurisprudence. However, Witr is most commonly offered with three rakats.

To end prayers for the night after Isha, the odd numbered rakats must have the niyyah of "wajib-ul-Lail", which is mandatory to "close" one's salat for that day.

Shi'ahs offer this as a one rakat salat at the end of salatul layl (the night prayer), which is an optional prayer according to some shi'ah scholars, and a wajib (obligatory) prayer according to others. This is to be prayed any time after Isha, up until fajr. The best time to pray it is the last third of the night (the night being divided into three, between maghrib and fajr of that night). It is considered highly meritorious by all shi'ah Muslims, and is said to bring numerous benefits to the believer, mainly gaining proximity to Allah. There are various methods of salatul-layl's performance, including shorter and longer versions, in the longer version the believer must perform 8 nawafil salat, in sets of 2 rakats each, then they must pray a 2 rakats salat called 'salatul shafa'ah' this is to include surah nas after surah fatihah in the first rakat and surah falaq after surah fatihah in the secound rakat, and unusually no qunut (a du'ah recited before going into ruku' of the second rakat of most prayers performed by shi'ahs) It is after this that the believer performs salatul witr, it's long method being - Starting with takbiratul ehram, then surah fatihah, then surah ikhlas, then surah falaq, then surah nas, then the hands are raised to recite qunut, upon which the believer can recite any du'a, however there are many recommended du'as for this purpose. Within qunut, the believer must pray for the forgiveness of 40 believers, then further prayers are read where the believer asks for forgiveness for himself a certain number of times using specified phrases and amounts of times to repeat those phrases. The believer then completes the salat in the usual way, by completing his qunut, reciting takbir whilst rasing his hands, going into ruku' and reciting the usual phrase for that, then returning up right and reciting takbir whilst doing so and upon being upright recites 'sami allahu liman hamida' (verily Allah has heard the one who has praised him) thereupon the believer recites takbir whilst raising his hands and goes into sajda. He recites the proscribed phrase in sajda rises, recites takbir whilst rising and then again whilst returnin to sajdah, then rises with takbir again and recites tashahud and salam, thus ending this prayer. It is then optional to recite certain other du'as and dhikr (remembrance of Allah through certain phrases and some of his names being repeated) It is then recommended to perform and sajdah ash-shukr (prostration of thanks) and to then recite ayatul kursi (verse of the throne) and then perform another sajdah ash-shukr.

====Eid====

Eid salat is performed on the morning of Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha. The Eid prayer is most likely an individual obligation (fard al-ayn) and Niyyah for both Eid salat is made as Wajib, though some Islamic scholars argue it is only a collective of the obligation(fard al-kifayah). It consists of two rakats, with seven (or three for the followers Imam Hanafi) takbirs offered before the start of the first rakat and five (or three for the followers of Imam Hanafi) before the second. After the salat is completed, a sermon (khutbah) is offered. However, the khutbah is not an integral part of the Eid salat. The Eid salat must be offered between sunrise and true noon i.e. between the time periods for Fajr and Zuhr.

===Istikhaarah===

Salat al-Istikhaarah is a prayer performed when a Muslim needs guidance on a particular matter, such as whether they should marry a certain person. In order to perform this salat one should pray a normal two rakats salat to completion. After completion one should say a du'a called the Istikhaarah du'a. The intention for the salah should be in one's heart to pray two rakats of salat followed by Istikhaarah. The salat can be performed at any of the times where salat is not forbidden.

The salat must be performed in the Arabic language.

===Qada===

In certain circumstances one may be unable to perform one's prayer within the prescribed time period (waqt). In this case, the prayer must be performed as soon as one is able to do so. Several Ahadith narrate that Muhammad stated that permissible reasons to perform Qada Salat are forgetfulness and accidentally sleeping through the prescribed time. However, knowingly sleeping through the prescribed time for Salat is deemed impermissible.

===Qasr and Jam' bayn as-Salaatayn===
When travelling over long distances, one may shorten some prayers, a practice known as qasr. Furthermore, several prayer times may be joined, which is referred to as Jam' bayn as-Salaatayn. Qasr involves shortening the obligatory components of the Zuhr, Asr, and Isha prayers to two rakats. Jam' bayn as-Salaatayn combines the Zuhr and Asr prayers into one prayer offered between noon and sunset, and the Maghrib and Isha prayers into one between sunset and Fajr. Neither Qasr nor Jam' bayn as-Salaatayn can be applied to the Fajr prayer.

There is no reference to Qasr during travel within the Qur'an itself; the Qur'an allows for Qasr when there is fear of attack, but does not forbid it for travel in non-hostile circumstances.

===Sajdah of forgetfulness===
During the ritual salat prayer, if a person forgets to do one of the actions of prayer he can make up for certain actions by performing two sujud at the end of the prayer. This can only be done if specific types of actions are forgotten by the person praying.

==Quranist Salat==
The concept of Quranist Salat Timings has been discussed in Hujjat Allah Al-Baligha (Arabic/Urdu) by Shah Waliullah. He said that there are 3 Salat timings (prayers) instead of the 5 Salats (prayers). Hujjat Allah Al-Baligha (Arabic / Urdu) by Shah Waliullah / Shah Wali Ullah 

The numbers of regular Salat mentioned by their respective names in Arabic in the Qur'an are three as follows:

# Ṣalāt Fajr (Dawn Prayer) 
# Aṣ-Ṣalāt al-Wusṭā ( The Middle Prayer) 
# Ṣalāt cIshā' (Night Prayer) 

According to Quranists, the three leftover Salat are not mentioned in Qur'an by their specific Arabic terms. Therefore, they should be prayed giving reference to Hadith of Muhammad.

===Salat timings according to Quranists and other minorities===
Salat Timings of Qur'an are mentioned, in particular three salat times are described and that they are recorded in a written document. The Qur'an states that you should interrupt any activity you were previously doing to pray, as this betters the individual. Also noted is the volume at which the salat should be uttered, somewhere in between spoken aloud and spoken in a low tone. 

The time for performing Fajr (Dawn) Prayer starts when the first thin ray of light is observed in the sky and ends at the first "taraf" (terminal) of the day, or sunrise 

The time for performing middle or Salat Al-Wusta can be observed from the moment the sun begins its descend from its highest point in the sky (duluk al shams) until sunset but before the darkness of the night (ghasaq al-layl) starts to set in. 

'Duluk ash-shams' can also mean 'sunset.' It literally means 'the rubbing of the sun.' The most accepted meaning is that this means the apparent rubbing of the sun with the horizon at sunset. Although, the meaning of a declining noon sun can also be found in Classical Arabic sources. Literally, it can imply a meaning of both sunset and dawn in its meaning of a sun making apparent contact i.e. 'rubbing' with the horizon.

The Qur'an, if we take the understanding of 'a declining noon sun' implies that the time of the Middle prayer ends with sunset. 

Some Quranists however believe that there are only two Salat, dawn and dusk including the times of night close to these two periods.

Some groups like Ahl Al-Quran (www.ahl-alquran.com) and The Submitters believe that the 5 Salat as they are practiced by Muslims today were passed down from Abraham generationally through the Arabs and the Children of Israel, to then be inherited by those who adopted the Quran (and rejected by most Jews and Christians), as a ritual of the religion of Abraham.

"Quranist" claims are based on dropping all reference to the traditions of Prophet Muhammad that clarify both the timings and names of the five salat as well as the detailed descriptions of the conditions to perform them, in contravention of the Islamic scholarly tradition, both Sunni and Shia.
