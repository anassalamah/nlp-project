[[Kronecker delta]]

In mathematics, the Kronecker delta or Kronecker's delta, named after Leopold Kronecker, is a function of two variables, usually integers. The function is 1 if the variables are equal, and 0 otherwise:
:
where the Kronecker delta &delta;ij is a piecewise function of variables and . For example, &delta;1 2 = 0, whereas &delta;3 3 = 1.

In linear algebra, the identity matrix can be written as
: 
and the inner product of vectors can be written as 
:

The Kronecker delta is used in many areas of mathematics, physics and engineering, primarily as an expedient to convey in a single equation what might otherwise take several lines of text.

== Properties ==
The following equations are satisfied: 
:
Therefore, δij can be considered as an identity matrix.

==Alternative notation==
Using the Iverson bracket:
: 

Often, the notation is used.

:

In linear algebra, it can be thought of as a tensor, and is written .
Sometimes the Kronecker delta is called the substitution tensor. Trowbridge, 1998. Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology. V15, 1 p291 

==Digital signal processing==
An impulse function
Similarly, in digital signal processing, the same concept is represented as a function on (the integers):

:

The function is referred to as an impulse, or unit impulse. And when it stimulates a signal processing element, the output is called the impulse response of the element.

==Properties of the delta function==

The Kronecker delta has the so-called sifting property that for :
:
and if the integers are viewed as a measure space, endowed with the counting measure, then this property coincides with the defining property of the Dirac delta function
:
and in fact Dirac's delta was named after the Kronecker delta because of this analogous property. In signal processing it is usually the context (discrete or continuous time) that distinguishes the Kronecker and Dirac "functions". And by convention, generally indicates continuous time (Dirac), whereas arguments like i, j, k, l, m, and n are usually reserved for discrete time (Kronecker). Another common practice is to represent discrete sequences with square brackets; thus: . It is important to note that the Kronecker delta is not the result of directly sampling the Dirac delta function.

The Kronecker delta forms the multiplicative identity element of an incidence algebra. . 

==Relationship to the Dirac delta function==
In probability theory and statistics, the Kronecker delta and Dirac delta function can both be used to represent a discrete distribution. If the support of a distribution consists of points , with corresponding probabilities , then the probability mass function of the distribution over can be written, using the Kronecker delta, as

:

Equivalently, the probability density function of the distribution can be written using the Dirac delta function as

:

Under certain conditions, the Kronecker delta can arise from sampling a Dirac delta function. For example, if a Dirac delta impulse occurs exactly at a sampling point and is ideally lowpass-filtered (with cutoff at the critical frequency) per the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, the resulting discrete-time signal will be a Kronecker delta function.

==Generalizations of the Kronecker delta==
If it is considered as a type (1,1) tensor, the Kronecker tensor, it can be written
 with a covariant index j and contravariant index i:
:

This (1,1) tensor represents:
* The identity mapping (or identity matrix), considered as a linear mapping or 
* The trace or tensor contraction, considered as a mapping 
* The map , representing scalar multiplication as a sum of outer products.

The generalized Kronecker delta of order 2p is a type (p,p) tensor that is a completely antisymmetric in its p upper indices, and also in its p lower indices.

In terms of an p × p determinant:

Using the Laplace expansion (Laplace's formula) of determinant, it may be defined recursively: A recursive definition requires a first case, which may be taken as δ = 1 for p = 0, or alternatively δ = δ for p = 1 (generalized delta in terms of standard delta).

=== Properties of generalized Kronecker delta ===
The generalized Kronecker delta may be used for anti-symmetrization:
: 
:

From the above equations and the properties of anti-symmetric tensor, we can derive the properties of the generalized Kronecker delta: 
:
:
:
which are the generalized version of formulae written in the section Properties.
The last formula is equivalent to the Cauchy–Binet formula.

Reducing the order via summation of the indices may be expressed by the identity 
 
:

Using both the summation rule for the case 1=p = n and the relation with the Levi-Civita symbol,
the summation rule of the Levi-Civita symbol is derived:
:

==Integral representations==
For any integer n, using a standard residue calculation we can write an integral representation for the Kronecker delta as the integral below, where the contour of the integral goes counterclockwise around zero. This representation is also equivalent to a definite integral by a rotation in the complex plane.

==The Kronecker comb==
The Kronecker comb function with period N is defined (using DSP notation) as:

:

where N and n are integers. The Kronecker comb thus consists of an infinite series of unit impulses N units apart, and includes the unit impulse at zero. It may be considered to be the discrete analog of the Dirac comb.

==Kronecker Integral ==

The Kronecker delta is also called degree of mapping of one surface into another. Suppose a mapping takes place from surface to that are boundaries of regions, and which is simply connected with one-to-one correspondence. In this framework, if s and t are parameters for , and to are each oriented by the outer normal n:

:

while the normal has the direction of:

:

Let x=x(u,v,w),y=y(u,v,w),z=z(u,v,w) be defined and smooth in a domain containing , and let these equations define the mapping of into . Then the degree of mapping is times the solid angle of the image S of with respect to the interior point of , O. If O is the origin of the region, , then the degree, is given by the integral:
