Some exegetes interpret the passage as a scathing critique of a servant people of Rome who do the Empire's bidding, interpreting that the author of Revelation was speaking of the Herodians - a party of Jews friendly to Rome and open to her influence, like the Hellenizers of centuries past - and later, corrupt Hasmoneans, where the ruler of Jerusalem or Roman Judea exercised his power at the pleasure of the Emperor, and was dependent on Roman influence, like Herod the Great in the Gospel according to Luke.

 and theologians point out that although Rome was the prevailing pagan power in the 1st century when the Book of Revelation was written, the symbolism of the whore of Babylon refers not to an invading infidel of foreign power, but to an apostate false queen, a former "bride" who has been unfaithful and who, even though she has been divorced and cast out because of unfaithfulness, continues to falsely claim to be the "queen" of the spiritual realm. Hunting the Whore of Babylon Douglas Connelly. "The Indispensable Guide to Practically Everything: Bible Prophecy and End Times". ISBN 978-0-8249-4772-9 http://www.thepreteristpost.com/t2-the-transformation-of-jerusalem This symbolism did not fit the case of Rome at the time. Proponents of this view suggest that the "seven mountains" in Rev 17:9 are the seven hills on which Jerusalem stands and the "fall of Babylon" in Rev 18 is the fall and destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD A commentary on the Apocalypse of John, Edmondo Lupieri, p.7 
The dress of the whore of Babylon is similar to the Jerusalem High Priest (Exodus 28:6).

Several Old Testament prophets referred to Jerusalem as being a spiritual harlot and a mother of such harlotry (Isaiah 1:21; Jeremiah 2:20; Jeremiah 3:1–11; Ezekiel 16:1–43; Ezekiel 23, Galatians 4:25). Some of the these Old Testament prophecies as well as the warnings in the New Testament concerning Jerusalem are in fact very close to the text concerning Babylon in Revelation, suggesting that John may well have actually been citing those prophecies in his description of Babylon. Revelation: The Apocalypse of St. John By John Drane, Richard Harries, p. 53 

For example, in Matthew 23:34–37 and Luke 11:47–51, Jesus himself assigned all of the bloodguilt for the killing of the prophets and of the saints (of all time) to the Pharisees of Jerusalem, and, in Revelation 17:6 and 18:20,24, almost identical phrasing is used in charging that very same bloodguilt to Babylon. This is also bolstered by Jesus' statement that "it's not possible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem." (Luke 13:33). A new and original exposition of the book of Revelation, pp. 252–253 

== Historicist and idealistic interpretations ==

===Catholic Church===
For medieval Spanish Catholics, the Whore of Babylon (Revelation, 17.4-5) "And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH." (a Christian allegory of evil) was incarnated by the Emirate of Cordoba.

Many Protestant and non-Catholic churches interpret the Whore of Babylon to be the Catholic Church which is in union with the pope.

====Pre-Reformation views====
Dante equated the corruption and simony in the office of the Papacy with the Whore of Babylon in Canto 19 of his Inferno:

:Di voi pastor s'accorse il Vangelista,
:quando colei che siede sopra l'acque
:puttaneggiar coi regi a lui fu vista...
: (Shepherds like you the Evangelist had in mind when he saw the one that sits upon the waters committing fornication with the kings.)

====Reformational view====

Whore of Babylon wearing a papal tiara from a woodcut in Luther's translation of the New Testament
Historicist interpreters commonly used the phrase "Whore of Babylon" to refer to the Roman Catholic Church. Reformation writers from Martin Luther (1483–1546) (who wrote On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church), John Calvin (1509–1564), and John Knox (1510–1572) (who wrote The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women) taught this association. 

Most early Protestant Reformers believed, and the modern Seventh-day Adventist Church teaches, that in Bible prophecy a woman represents a church. Commentary on Daniel and Revelation. Google Books. Keys To Bible Symbols see Woman, pure and Woman, corrupt on bottom of page "I have likened the daughter of Zion To a lovely and delicate woman." (Jeremiah 6:2 ) A harlot, it is argued, is representative of a church that has been unfaithful:

:"Go, take yourself a wife of harlotry
:And children of harlotry,
:For the land has committed great harlotry
:By departing from the .” (Hosea 1:2 ) See also "They have committed adultery with their idols" (Ezekiel 23:37). 

They also believed that the primary location of this unfaithful church is stated in the same chapter.

:"And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth." (Revelation 17:18)

The connection noted above on the seven hills of Rome is argued to locate the church. Walvoord, John F. "Every Prophecy of the Bible". pg. 603–610. ISBN 978-1-56476-758-5. LaHaye, Tim. "Revelation Unveiled". pg. 262–271. ISBN 978-0-310-23005-2 (softcover). http://www.mystery-babylon.net/ 

Identification of the Pope as the Antichrist was written into Protestant creeds such as the Westminster Confession of 1646. The identification of the Roman Catholic Church with the Whore of Babylon is kept in the Scofield Reference Bible (whose 1917 edition identified "ecclesiastical Babylon" with "apostate Christendom headed by the Papacy").

====Sedevacantist view====
Some traditionalist Catholics who hold the position of Sedevacantism, most notably the Most Holy Family Monastery, believe that a counterfeit bride – a Counter-Catholic Church – will arise in the end times in order to deceive faithful Catholics; they teach that this counterfeit Church is the Roman Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council. 

====Seventh-day Adventist view====
Adventist believe that the fallen state of traditional Christianity can be seen especially in the Roman Catholic Church, which they teach is the great whore in prophecy as seen in Rev 17:1-5, a false church. Her harlot daughters are interpreted as other false churches which adopt Catholic Church's many non-biblical doctrines. They hold that the persecution of the true believers prophesied in Rev 17:6 is fulfilled in the persecution of Waldensians and the Inquisition.

Seventh-day Adventists interpret Rev 17:18 as a prophecy of the false church which has power over the kings of the earth. They consider the Papacy to be in apostasy for allowing pagan rituals, beliefs and ceremonies to come into the church, having those who pointed out its apostasy persecuted and killed and never repenting of or fully admitting the true extent of its actions. They see the Papacy stepping in after the Roman Empire as fulfillment of 2 Thessalonians 2:7 which says "For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way."

Ellen Gould White in her book The Great Controversy wrote that "Spiritual Babylon" would have worldwide influence, affecting "all nations", that Imperial Roman Empire could not meet the criteria, as she wrote that it only had influence in the Old World. Like many reformation-era Protestant leaders, her writings too describe the Catholic Church as a fallen church and it plays a nefarious eschatological role as the antagonist against God's true church and that the pope is the Antichrist. The Antichrist and the Protestant Reformation 

Ellen Gould White concluded that the true "Whore of Babylon" must be the Roman Catholic Church. The Great Controversy 

====Latter-day Saint view====
It has been popular within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to equate the Whore of Babylon and its Book of Mormon parallel, the "great and abominable church", with the Roman Catholic Church. However, official publications of the LDS Church have discouraged that interpretation without offering a definitive identification. Dennis A. Wright, "Great and Abominable Church", Encyclopedia of Mormonism (Daniel H. Ludlow ed.) (Macmillan: New York, 1992). Stephen E. Robinson, "Warring Against the Saints of God", Ensign, January 1988. 

===The world empire of false religion===
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Whore of Babylon represents "the world empire of false religion", What Does The Bible Really Teach - Jehovah's Witnesses Official Web Site referring to all elements of worldly religions that do not adhere to biblical truth as published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society (WTS) and as interpreted and defined by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses (the institutional and leadership organizations of Jehovah's Witnesses). This includes, but is not limited to, Christendom, a term they use to refer to "professed Christianity" (Nominal Christianity) as opposed to "true Christianity". Jehovah's Witnesses literature often mentions the Catholic religion when discussing The Great Harlot of Babylon, and the subsequent attack on her by the political powers, signaling the beginning of the "great tribulation". The Watchtower, April 15, 1962, p. 229 par. 6 Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania | "Christendom Has Failed God! After Her End, What?" The Watchtower, October 15, 1961, p. 229 par. 6 "When All Nations Unite Under God's Kingdom" Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania | Revelation 11:15-18: 

They believe that the harlot&mdash;the empire of false religion and an enemy of God&mdash;has persecuted God's prophets and people, and that 'false religion'&mdash;all religions that have dealings with governmental or commercial elements of the world;commits and has committed "fornication" with the world's political and commercial elements. What Does the Bible Really Teach? p. 219 par. 2 - p. 220 par. 3 published by Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania 

===Christianity===
The Twelve Tribes communities, a new religious movement that has some things in common with Christianity and Messianic Judaism but does not self-identify as Christian, views Christianity itself (both Catholic and Protestant) as the whore of Babylon.
