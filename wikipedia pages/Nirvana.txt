[[Nirvana]]

 (; nibbāna&#x202f;; ) literally means "blown out", as in a candle. Richard Gombrich, Theravada Buddhism: A Social History from Ancient Benāres to Modern Colombo. Routledge It is most commonly associated with Buddhism. Donald S. lopez Jr., Nirvana, Encyclopedia Britannica In Indian religions, the attainment of nirvana is moksha, liberation from the repeating cycle of birth, life and death (reincarnation). Gavin Flood, Nirvana. In: John Bowker (ed.), Oxford Dictionary of World Religions 

In the Buddhist context nirvana refers to the imperturbable stillness of mind after the fires of desire, aversion, and delusion have been finally extinguished. In Hindu philosophy, it is the union with the divine ground of existence Brahman (Supreme Being) and the experience of blissful egolessness.

===Abhidharma===
The abhidharma-mahāvibhāsa-sāstra, a sarvastivādin commentary, 3rd century BCE and later, describes 
 the possible etymological interpretations of the word nirvana. 

 Vana +Nir Nature of nirvana Direct quotes 
 The path of rebirth Leaving off Being away from the path of rebirth permanently avoiding all paths of transmigration. 
 Forest Without To be in a state which has got rid of, for ever, of the dense forest of the three fires of lust, malice and delusion 
 Weaving Being free Freedom from the knot of the vexations of karmas and in which the texture of both birth and death is not to be woven 
 Stench or stink Without Being without and free from all stench of karmas 

Each of the five aggregates is called a skandha, which means "tree trunk." All five skandha serve to inform the study of experience, or else missing their causal relations leads away from the path to nirvana. Skandha also means "heap" or "pile" or "mass," which is the nature of their interdependence, like an endless knot's path, or a forest.

==Origins==
Nirvāṇa is a term used in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism. It leads to moksha, liberation from samsara, or release from a state of suffering, after an often lengthy period of bhāvanā or sādhanā.

The idea of moksha is connected to the Vedic culture, which had notion of amrtam, "immortality", and also a notion of a timeless, an "unborn", "the still point of the turning world of time". It was also its timeless structure, the whole underlying "the spokes of the invariable but incessant wheel of time". The hope for life after death started with notions of going to the worlds of the Fathers or Ancestors and/or the world of the Gods or Heaven. The continuation of life after death came to be seen as dependent on sacrificial action, karma, These ideas further developed into the notion of insight into the real nature of the timeless Brahman and the paramatman. This basic scheme underlies Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, where "the ultimate aim is the timeless state of moksa, or, as the Buddhists first seem to have called it, nirvana."

Although the term occurs in the literatures of a number of ancient Indian traditions, the concept is most commonly associated with Buddhism. It was later adopted in the Bhagavad Gita of the Mahabharata.

==Jainism==
Kalpasutra folio on Mahavira Nirvana. Note the crescent shaped Siddhashila, a place where all siddhas reside after nirvana.

The terms moksa and nirvana are often used interchangeably in the Jain texts. : "Moksa and Nirvana are synonymous in Jainism". p.168 Michael Carrithers, Caroline Humphrey (1991) The Assembly of listeners: Jains in society Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521365058: "Nirvana: A synonym for liberation, release, moksa." p.297 In Jainism, moksha (liberation) follows nirvāṇa. Nirvana means final release from the karmic bondage. An arhat becomes a siddha ("one who is accomplished") after nirvāṇa. When an enlightened human, such as an arihant or a Tirthankara, extinguishes his remaining aghatiya karmas and thus ends his worldly existence, it is called nirvāṇa. Jains celebrate Diwali as the day of nirvāṇa of Mahavira. Uttaradhyana Sutra provides an account of Gautama explaining the meaning of nirvāṇa to Kesi, a disciple of Parshva. 

==Buddhism==

In the Buddhist tradition, nirvana is described as the extinguishing of the fires that cause suffering. These fires are typically identified as the fires of attachment (raga), aversion (dvesha) and ignorance (moha or avidya). When the fires are extinguished, suffering (dukkha) comes to an end. The cessation of suffering is described as complete peace.

Bhikkhu Bodhi states:
:The state of perfect peace that comes when craving is eliminated is Nibbāna (nirvāṇa), the unconditioned state experienced while alive with the extinguishing of the flames of greed, aversion, and delusion.

==Hinduism==

According to Zaehner and "many commentators", nirvana is a Buddhist term rather than a Hindu term. The term nirvana was not used in Hinduism prior to its use in the Bhagavad Gita, though according to van Buitenen the use of the term was not confined to Buddhism at the time the Bhagavad Gita was written. According to Johnson the use of the term nirvana is borrowed from the Buddhists to link the Buddhist state of liberation with Brahman, the supreme or absolute principle of the Upanishads and the Vedic tradition.

===Moksha===
In Hinduism, moksha is the liberation from the cycle of birth and death and one's worldly conception of self. According to Hindson & Caner, when a person achieves moksha, they have reached nirvana; while according to Flood, "The attainment of nirvana is thus moksa." 

Moksha is derived from the root mu(n)c (), which means free, let go, release, liberate. मुच Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Germany (2008) Sten Rohde, Deliver us from Evil: studies on the Vedic ideas of salvation, Ejnar Munksgaard, Copenhagen, pp 25-35 In Vedas and early Upanishads, the word mucyate () appears, which means to be set free or release - such as of a horse from its harness.

According to Aurobindo, the last bondage is the passion for liberation itself, which must be renounced before the soul can be perfectly free, and the last knowledge is the realisation that there is none bound, none desirous of freedom, but the soul is for ever and perfectly free, that bondage is an illusion and the liberation from bondage is an illusion too. 

===Brahmanirvana in the Bhagavad Gita===

Brahma nirvana (nirvana in Brahman) is the state of release or liberation; the union with the divine ground of existence (Brahman) and the experience of blissful ego-lessness. The term brahmanirvana is used 5 times in the Bhagavad Gita:
* verse 2.72: sthitvāsyāmantakāle'pi brahmanirvāṇamṛcchati
* 5.24 (and following 2 verses): sa yogī brahmanirvāṇaṃ brahmabhūto'dhigacchati
* 6.15: śāntiṃ nirvāṇaparamāṃ matsaṃsthāmadhigacchati

According to Helena Blavatsky, in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains that Brahma nirvana can be attained by one who is capable of cognizing the essence of Brahman; by getting rid of vices, becoming free from duality, free from the worldly attractions and anger, dedicated to spiritual pursuits, having subdued thoughts and cognized Atman, and dedicating oneself to the good of all. Bhagavad Gita 5.24, 5,25, 5.26 

According to Mahatma Gandhi, the Hindu and Buddhist understanding of nirvana are different:

According to Gavin Flood, 

===Brahma Kumaris===
In Brahma Kumaris philosophy, nirvana is reaching the meta world called paramdham (supreme abode) or shantidham (abode of peace) and is the highest of the three worlds. It is the original home of the soul and Supreme Soul, Shiva.
