[[Centre Georges Pompidou]]

Centre Georges Pompidou (; commonly shortened to Centre Pompidou; also known as the Pompidou Centre in English) is a complex in the Beaubourg area of the 4th arrondissement of Paris, near Les Halles, rue Montorgueil and the Marais. It was designed in the style of high-tech architecture by the architectural team of Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano, along with Gianfranco Franchini.

It houses the Bibliothèque publique d'information, a vast public library, the Musée National d'Art Moderne which is the largest museum for modern art in Europe, and IRCAM, a centre for music and acoustic research. Because of its location, the Centre is known locally as Beaubourg (). It is named after Georges Pompidou, the President of France from 1969 to 1974 who commissioned the building, and was officially opened on 31 January 1977 by President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. The Centre Pompidou has had over 150 million visitors since 1977. 

The sculpture, Horizontal by Alexander Calder, a free-standing mobile that is twenty-five feet high, was placed in 2012 in front of the Centre Pompidou. 

==History==
Centre Georges-Pompidou
The idea for a multicultural complex sprouted from André Malraux, the first minister of cultural affairs, was the western prophet of art and culture as centralized political power. The idea for the Centre Pompidou as a nerve centre of the French art and culture, bringing together in one place the different forms of expression, can be traced back in a way to Malraux' ideas.(5) In the 1960s the city planners decided to move the foodmarkets of Les Halles, the historical structures were greatly prized and it was proposed that some of the cultural institutes would be appropriate occupants. Paris as a city of culture and art needed a boost and voices were raised to move the Musée d'Art Moderne to this more appropriate location. Paris also needed a large, free public library, as one did not exist at this time. At first the debate concerned Les Halles, but as the controversy settled, in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle announced the Plateau Beaubourg as the new site for the library. A year later in 1969, the new president adopted the Beaubourg project and decided it to be the location of both the new library and a center for the contemporary arts. In the process of developing the project, the IRCAM (Institut de recherche et coordination acoustique/musique) was also housed in the complex.

By the mid-1980s, the Centre Pompidou was becoming the victim of its huge and unexpected popularity, its many activities, and a complex administrative structure. When Dominique Bozo returned to the Center in 1981 as director of the Musee National d'Art Moderne, he re-installed the museum, bringing out the full range of its collections and displaying the many major acquisitions that had been made. John Russell (April 29, 1993), Dominique Bozo, 58, Expert on Picasso, Is Dead New York Times. By 1992, the Centre de Création Industrielle was incorporated into the Centre Pompidou. 

Since reopening in 2000 after a three-year renovation, the Centre Pompidou has improved the logistics of a visit. Visitors can only access the escalators if they pay to enter the museum. Farah Nayeri (November 2, 2006), Paris's Pompidou, 30 Next Year, Courts the Young, Branches Out Bloomberg. 

==Architecture==

=== Design ===
Building technology
The Centre was designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano; British architect Richard Rogers; and Italian architect Gianfranco Franchini, assisted by Ove Arup & Partners. The project was awarded to this team in an architectural design competition, whose results were announced in 1971. It was the first time in France international architects were allowed to participate. World renowned architects Oscar Niemeyer, Jean Prouvé and Philip Johnson made up the jury which would select one design out of the 681 entries Richard Copans. Le Centres Georges Pompidou. Available from: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkgnXkBcVGs&feature=plcp date 25/11/2012 22:14 

National Geographic described the reaction to the design as "love at second sight." National Geographic, October 1980, pg. 469 An article in Le Figaro declared "Paris has its own monster, just like the one in Loch Ness." But two decades later, while reporting on Rogers' winning the Pritzker Prize in 2007, The New York Times noted that the design of the Centre "turned the architecture world upside down" and that "Mr. Rogers earned a reputation as a high-tech iconoclast with the completion of the 1977 Pompidou Centre, with its exposed skeleton of brightly coloured tubes for mechanical systems. The Pritzker jury said the Pompidou "revolutionized museums, transforming what had once been elite monuments into popular places of social and cultural exchange, woven into the heart of the city.". The building was so modern and different, it stood out from those around it. The outside of the building reflects the modern art that is held inside. The Centre shows that High-Tec style will be the future.

Initially, all of the functional structural elements of the building were colour-coded: green pipes are plumbing, blue ducts are for climate control, electrical wires are encased in yellow, and circulation elements and devices for safety (e.g., fire extinguishers) are red. However, recent visits suggest that this color-coding has partially lapsed, and many of the elements are simply painted white.

=== Construction ===
The Centre was built by GTM and completed in 1977. The building cost 993 million 1972 French francs. Renovation work conducted from October 1996 to January 2000 was completed on a budget of 576 million 1999 francs.

== Expansion ==

=== Provincial branch ===
:Main article Centre Pompidou-Metz
The Centre Pompidou-Metz.
In 2010, the Centre Georges Pompidou opened a provincial branch, the Centre Pompidou-Metz, in Metz a city 170 miles east of Paris. The new museum is part of an effort to expand the display of contemporary arts beyond Paris's large museums. The new museum's building was designed by the architect Shigeru Ban with a curving and asymmetrical pagoda-like roof topped by a spire and punctured by upper galleries. The 77 meters central spire is a nod to the year the Centre Georges Pompidou of Paris was built – 1977. The Centre Pompidou-Metz displays unique, temporary exhibitions from the collection of the Musée National d'Art Moderne, which is not on display at the main Parisian museum. 
Since its inauguration, the institution has became the most visited cultural venue in France outside Paris accommodating 550,000 visitors/year. 

Launched in 2011 in Chaumont, the museum for the first time went on the road to the French provinces with a selection of works from the permanent collection. To do this, it designed and constructed a mobile gallery, which, in the spirit of a circus, will strike camp for a few months at a time in towns throughout the country. Lennox Morrison (October 14, 2011), Ladies and Gentlemen... Cirque Pompidou Wall Street Journal. However, in 2013, the Centre Pompidou halted its mobile-museum project because of the cost.

=== International expansion ===

==== Europe ====
In 2015, around 70 works from the Centre Pompidou's collection are planned to go on show in a temporary glass-and-steel structure called The Cube in Málaga. According to the Spanish newspaper El País, the annual €1 million cost of the five-year project will be funded by the city council. Gareth Harris (December 31, 2013), Málaga’s mayor says the Pompidou is coming The Art Newspaper. The partnership with Málaga was announced by the city's mayor but was not confirmed by Pompidou Center president Alain Seban until April 24, 2014, at which time he also revealed that the pop-up museum is scheduled to open in early 2015. http://www.katedeimling.com/pompidou-center-will-launch-short-term-satellites-in-spain-mexico-and-possibly-brazil/ 

==== Asia ====
In a joint proposal with the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum presented in 2005, the Centre Pompidou planned to build a museum of modern and contemporary art, design and the media arts in Hong Kong's West Kowloon Cultural District. Carol Vogel (October 28, 2005), From 'Not Interested' to a Collaboration New York Times. In 2007, the then president Bruno Racine announced plans to open a museum carrying the Pompidou's name in Shanghai, with its programming to be determined by the Pompidou. The location chosen for the new museum was a former fire station in the Luwan district's Huaihai Park. However, the scheme never materialized, reportedly due to the lack of a legal framework for a non-profit foreign institution to operate in China. Gareth Harris (April 30, 2012), Pompidou plans to go global: focus is Brazil, India, China The Art Newspaper. Other projects include the Pompidou’s joint venture with the King Abdulaziz Centre for World Culture, an arts complex incorporating a museum in Dhahran, the building of which has stalled.

==== South America ====
There have been rumors of a pop-up Pompidou satellite museum in Brazil since Alain Seban announced the plan for these temporary locations back in 2012. http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Pompidou-plans-to-go-global:-focus-is-Brazil,-India,-China/26316 At a talk on satellite museums at the Guggenheim on April 24, 2014, Alain Seban suggested that Brazil may be the third country to a host a temporary satellite museum, after Spain and Mexico. http://www.katedeimling.com/pompidou-center-will-launch-short-term-satellites-in-spain-mexico-and-possibly-brazil/
