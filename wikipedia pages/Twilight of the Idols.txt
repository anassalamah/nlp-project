[[Twilight of the Idols]]

Twilight of the Idols, or, How to Philosophize with a Hammer () is a book by Friedrich Nietzsche, written in 1888, and published in 1889.

==Genesis==
Twilight of the Idols was written in just over a week, between 26 August and 3 September 1888, while Nietzsche was on holiday in Sils-Maria. Large, Duncan (trans). Twilight of the Idols (Oxford: Oxford University Press), pg. ix As Nietzsche's fame and popularity was spreading both inside and outside Germany, he felt that he needed a text that was a short introduction to his work; Twilight of the Idols is his attempt at this.
Originally titled A Psychologist's Idleness, it was renamed Twilight of the Idols, or, How to Philosophize with a Hammer.

The latter title, Götzen-Dämmerung in German, is a pun on the title of Richard Wagner's opera, Götterdämmerung, or 'Twilight of the Gods'. Götze is a German word for "idol" or "false god". Walter Kaufmann has suggested that in his use of the word Nietzsche might be indebted to Francis Bacon. Kaufmann W., The Portable Nietzsche, New York: Viking, 1954, p463 

==Synopsis==
Nietzsche criticizes German culture of the day as unsophisticated and nihilistic, and shoots some disapproving arrows at key French, British, and Italian cultural figures who represent similar tendencies. In contrast to all these alleged representatives of cultural "decadence", Nietzsche applauds Caesar, Napoleon, Goethe, Thucydides and the Sophists as healthier and stronger types. The book states the transvaluation of all values as Nietzsche's final and most important project, and gives a view of antiquity wherein the Romans for once take precedence over the ancient Greeks.

The book is divided up into several sections:

===Foreword===

===Maxims and Arrows===
Single sentence aphorisms on a variety of topics.

===The Problem of Socrates===

He establishes early on in the section The Problem of Socrates that the value of life cannot be estimated and any judgment concerning it only reveals the person's life-denying or life-affirming tendencies. Nietzsche, Friedrich. Twilight of the Idols; and the Anti-Christ. Trans. R. J. Hollingdale. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1977, pgs. 40, 55. He tries to show how philosophers from Socrates onwards were "decadents", employing dialectical rationality as a tool for self-preservation as the authority of tradition breaks down.

===Reason in Philosophy===
Nietzsche denies many of Plato's ideas, specifically that of Being and Becoming, the world of the forms, and the fallibility of the senses. More precisely, he does not believe that one should refute the senses, as Plato did. Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols, pg. 45. This goes against Nietzsche's ideals of human excellence in that it is a symptom of personal decadence. Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols, pg. 49. By decadence, Nietzsche is referring to a fading of life, vitality and an embrace of weakness. In Nietzsche's view if one is to accept a non-sensory, unchanging world as superior and our sensory world as inferior, then one is adopting a hate of nature and thus a hate of the sensory world - the world of the living. Nietzsche postulates that only one who is weak, sickly or ignoble would subscribe to such a belief.

Nietzsche goes on to relate this obsession with the non-physical realm to Christianity and the concept of Heaven. Nietzsche indicates that the belief in the Christian God is a similar decadence and hate of life. Given that Christians believe in Heaven, which is in concept similar to Plato's ideas of the world of forms (a changeless, eternal world) and that Christians divide the world into the "real" (heaven) and the apparent (living) world, they too hate nature.

===How the "True World" Finally Became Fiction===
In this section, Nietzsche demonstrates the process by which previous philosophers have fictionalized the apparent world, casting the product of the senses into doubt, and thereby removing the concept of the real world. The section is divided into six parts:

# The wise and pious man dwells in the real world, which he attains through his wisdom (skills in perception warrant a more accurate view of the real world).
# The wise and pious man doesn't dwell in the real world, but rather it is promised to him, a goal to live for. (ex: to the sinner who repents)
# The real world is unattainable and cannot be promised, yet remains a consolation when confronted with the perceived injustices of the apparent world.
# If the real world is not attained, then it is unknown. Therefore, there is no duty to the real world, and no consolation derived from it.
# The idea of a real world has become useless- it provides no consolation or motive. It is therefore cast aside as a useless abstraction.
# What world is left? The concept of the real world has been abolished, and with it, the idea of an apparent world follows.

===Morality as Anti-Nature===

Every healthy morality is governed by a vital instinct. Anti-morality is the opposite, it is precisely against vital instincts.

===The Four Great Errors===

In the chapter The Four Great Errors, he suggests that people, especially Christians, confuse the effect for the cause, and that they project the human ego and subjectivity on to other things, thereby creating the illusionary concept of being, and therefore also of the thing-in-itself and God. In reality, motive or intention is "an accompaniment to an act" Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols, pg. 60. rather than the cause of that act. By removing causal agency based on free, conscious will, Nietzsche critiques the ethics of accountability, suggesting that everything is necessary in a whole that can neither be judged nor condemned, because there is nothing outside of it. Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols, pg. 65. What people typically deem "vice" is in fact merely "the inability not to react to a stimulus." Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols, pg. 54. In this light, the concept of morality becomes purely a means of control: "the doctrine of will has been invented essentially for the purpose of punishment, that is of finding guilty." Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols, pg. 64. 

==Cultural impact==
Nietzsche's original line "From life's school of war: what does not kill me makes me stronger" has been referenced many times. G. Gordon Liddy, former assistant to President Richard Nixon, paraphrased it as "That which does not kill us makes us stronger." In that phrasing, it has appeared in many places, including the opening of the film Conan the Barbarian (1982), Kanye West's song "Stronger" (2007), and Kelly Clarkson's song "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)" (2012). Marilyn Manson, in his song "Leave A Scar", paraphrases Nietzsche to make a different point: "whatever doesn't kill you is gonna' leave a scar."
