[[Mary Baker Eddy]]

Mary Baker Eddy (born Mary Morse Baker, July 16, 1821 – December 3, 1910) was the founder of Christian Science, a religious movement that emerged in New England in the late 19th century. Eddy is the author of the movement's textbook, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures (first published 1875), and founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist (1879). She also founded the Christian Science Publishing Society (1898), which continues to publish a number of periodicals, including The Christian Science Monitor (1908).

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Mary Morse Baker was born in Bow, New Hampshire, the youngest of six children of Abigail and Mark Baker. Although raised a Congregationalist, she came to reject teachings such as predestination and original sin. She suffered chronic illness and developed a strong interest in biblical accounts of early Christian healing. At the age of eight, she wrote, she began to hear voices calling her name; she would go to her mother only to learn that her mother had not called her. In her autobiography, she relates one of these experiences:

Several of her biographers, such as Willa Cather and Georgine Milmine in their The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy (1909), have written that Eddy suffered from various nervous disorders as a child and adult. Cather, Willa and Milmine, Georgine. The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science. University of Nebraska Press, 1993 , p. 22. Eddy herself wrote of her problems with food when she was young; another biographer, Gillian Gill, wrote that Eddy probably suffered from an eating disorder. Gill, Gillian. Mary Baker Eddy. Da Capo Press, 1998, pp. 47–48. 

Congregational church – Tilton, NH
Eddy frequently expressed confidence in God's love, which placed her at odds with her father's views on predestination and judgment day, leading to a religious crisis when she was twelve and first eligible to join the Congregational church. Amid their clash of views Eddy developed a fever; she wrote that the fever lifted after prayer: Wilbur 1907, pp. 21–37. 

Eddy did not join the Congregational church until she was 17 at Sanbornton Bridge, New Hampshire (present-day Tilton). A fragile child, she suffered from a number of physical complaints. The exact nature of these illnesses, and their possible psychosomatic or hysterical (as it was called at that time) nature, is still a subject of debate. Eddy's letters from this time, now at the Mary Baker Eddy Library in Boston, Massachusetts, portray her sufferings and search for relief. In an effort to find health in her adult years, she tried homeopathy, medicine, dietary cures, mesmerism, hydropathy, and other popular "cures" of the day. None of those methods brought lasting health. Gill 1998 

===Early marriages===
On December 10, 1843, Eddy married George Washington Glover. Wilbur 1907, pp. 38–48. He died of yellow fever on June 27, 1844, a little over two months before the birth of their only child, George Washington Glover. As a single mother of poor health, Eddy wrote some political pieces for the New Hampshire Patriot. She also worked as a substitute teacher in the New Hampshire Conference Seminary. Her success there led to her briefly opening an experimental school which was an early attempt to introduce kindergarten methods (love instead of harshness for discipline; interest instead of compulsion to impart knowledge), but this, like other similar attempts at this time was not accepted and soon closed. The social climate of the time made it very difficult for a widowed woman to earn money.

 Eddy in the 1850s
Her mother died in November 1849 and about a year later, her father remarried Elizabeth Patterson Duncan. Eddy continued to have poor health and her son was put into the care of neighbors by her father and stepmother. She married Dr. Daniel Patterson, a dentist, in 1853, hoping he would adopt the young boy. Patterson apparently signed papers to that effect on their wedding day, but failed to follow through on his promise. Wilbur 1907, pp. 49–66. 

Eddy was often bedridden during this period. Her mother had died and her father had remarried a woman who did not welcome Eddy or her child. A neighbor couple with a small farm and no children took up the care of the boy for a fee. When this couple, who found the boy useful in the farm labor, decided to move to the Prairie territories, without Eddy's knowledge, some of Eddy's family arranged that the couple should take the child along with money given them by her father. The failure of Patterson to make good on his promises of reunification with her now far-distant son plunged Eddy into despair. Her desire to recover her health led her to seek healing in the various systems fashionable of the period, including electrical treatments, morphine, homeopathy, hydropathy, Grahamism, and mesmerism. Piepmeier, Alison. Out in Public: Configurations of Women's Bodies in Nineteenth-Century America. The University of North Carolina Press, 2004. 

Patterson ran into financial difficulty. He mortgaged Eddy's furniture, jewelry, and books, but was unable to keep current on their property in Groton, New Hampshire, and was eventually forced to vacate. Eddy's sister, Abigail, moved her to Rumney, six miles away. 

==Spiritualism==
Eddy often attempted to distinguish Christian Science from Spiritualism, and wrote in her later publications that she had never been a Spiritualist. According to the Christian Scientist Robert Peel, in the spring of 1864 Eddy gave a public talk in Warren, Maine, opposing Spiritualism. Peel, Robert. Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1966, pp. 183-84. Hiram Crafts, the first student Eddy taught after her discovery of Christian Science in 1866, stated in an affidavit given some years later: “At that date I was a Spiritualist, but her teachings changed my views on that subject and I gave up spiritualism.... She taught me from the Scriptures and from manuscripts that she wrote when she taught me." Peel 1966, p. 212. 

Reports that Eddy was at one time a medium in Boston surfaced after she became well known. Peel 1966, p. 133. At the time she was said to be a medium there, she lived some distance away. Gill 1998, p. 627. She was also bedridden during that time. Peel has been challenged by other researchers who write that Eddy acted as a trance channeler, and worked in and around Boston as a Spiritualist medium giving public séances for money. Ankerberg, John. The Facts on the Mind Sciences. Atri Publishing, 2011. 

According to Gillian Gill, Eddy knew spiritualists and took part in some of their activities, but was never a convinced believer. Gill 1998, pp. 179-180. For example, in 1864, she visited a friend, Sarah Crosby, who believed in Spiritualism. Eddy attempted to show Crosby the folly of believing in Spiritualism by playing a prank on her and pretending to channel Eddy’s brother Albert and writing letters she attributed to him. Eddy was poking fun at Spiritualism and told Crosby so at the time, but this was not enough to shake Crosby's belief in the practice. Wilbur, Sybil. "The Story of the Real Mrs. Eddy," Human Life, March 1907, p. 10. According to researcher Georgine Milmine, Eddy claimed to channel the spirit of her dead brother Albert in 1864, and also performed automatic handwriting.

In another example of Eddy's familiarity with Spiritualism but her disbelief in it, some time between 1866 and 1870, Eddy boarded at the home of Brene Paine Clark, who was very interested in it. Gill 1998, p. 172. Seances were often conducted there, but Eddy and Clark engaged in vigorous, good-natured arguments about them. Gill 1998, p. 173. Eddy's arguments against Spiritualism convinced at least another who was there at the time, Hiram Crafts, that "her science was far superior to spirit teachings." Gill 1998, p. 174. Clark's son, George, tried to convince Eddy to take up Spiritualism, but he said she abhorred the idea. Peel 1966, pp. 210-211. According to Cather and Milmine, Mrs. Richard Hazeltine, who attended seances at Clark's home, Milmine, Georgine. "Mary Baker G. Eddy," McClure's Magazine, May 1907, 108. said Eddy had acted as a trance medium, claiming to channel the spirits of the Apostles. Cather and Milmine 1909 (reprint edition, 1971), pp. 64–68, 111–116. Eddy was also known for channeling messages from the dead brother of her friend Sarah Crosby. According to Martin Gardner, Eddy's mediumship converted Crosby to Spiritualism. Gardner, Martin. The Healing Revelations of Mary Baker Eddy: The Rise and Fall of Christian Science. Prometheus Books, 1993, p. 26. 

On the subject of Eddy and Spiritualism, Frank Podmore, who relied mainly on Milmine's research, Podmore, Frank. Mesmerism and Christian Science: A Short History of Mental Healing. George W. Jacobs and Company, 1909, p. 262. wrote:

Mary Gould, a Spiritualist from Lynn, claimed that one of the spirits that Eddy channeled was Abraham Lincoln. According to eyewitness reports cited by Milmine, Eddy was still attending séances as late as 1872 (six years after her discovery of Christian Science). Milmine, Georgine. 1909. Also see Hall, Robert. 1916. The Modern Siren. H. L. Thatcher. Online In these later séances Eddy would attempt to convert her audience into accepting Christian Science. Leonard, Todd. 2005. Talking to the Other Side: a History of Modern Spiritualism And Mediumship: A Study of the Religion, Science, Philosophy and Mediums that Encompass this American-Made Religion. iUniverse, Inc., pp. 32-33 Eddy showed extensive familiarity with Spiritualist practice but denounced it in her Christian Science writings. Christian Science versus Spiritualism Ann Braude wrote that there were similarities between Spiritualism and Christian Science, but the main difference was that Eddy after her discovery of Christian Science came to believe that spirit manifestations had never really had bodies to begin with, because matter is unreal and that all that really exists is spirit, before and after death. Braude, Ann. Radical Spirits: Spiritualism and Women's Rights in Nineteenth-Century America. Indiana University Press, 2001, p. 186. 

==Study with Phineas Quimby and his influence==
Eddy's methods are seen as having derived from the ideas of Phineas Quimby and homeopathy. Schoepflin, Rennie. "Christian Science", in Paul S. Boyer (ed.). The Oxford Companion to United States History. Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 119. 
In October 1862 Eddy became a patient of Phineas Quimby, NOTES: Gill (1998, p. 131) REFERENCES: Gill, Gillian (1998), Mary Baker Eddy, Reading: Perseus Books, ISBN#0-7382-0042-5. a magnetic healer from Maine. She benefited temporarily by his treatment. NOTES: Peel (1972, p. 172); Gill (1998, p. 135) REFERENCES: Peel, Robert (1971), Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery, Boston: The Christian Science Publishing Society, ISBN#0-87510-085-6; Gill, Gillian (1998), Mary Baker Eddy, Reading: Perseus Books, ISBN#0-7382-004. From 1862 to 1865 Quimby and Eddy engaged in lengthy discussions about healing methods practiced by Quimby and others. NOTES: Gill (Chapter 7) REFERENCES: Gill, Gillian (1998), Mary Baker Eddy, Reading: Perseus Books, ISBN#0-7382-0042-5. It is said by Quimby's supporters that his beliefs influenced her later thinking and writing, although to what extent has been frequently disputed. Originally, Eddy gave Quimby much credit for his hypnotic treatments of her nervous and physical conditions and initially thought his brand of mesmerism entirely benign. An experience in 1866, when Eddy had a physical healing of serious injuries while reading the Bible, led her to investigate more and more into the system of healing she would eventually term "Christian Science." Notes: Peel (Chapter 6, Sections I, II); Gill (1998, p. 167-168) REFERENCES: Peel, Robert (1972), Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery, Boston: The Christian Science Publishing Society, ISBN#0-87510-085-6; Gill, Gillian (1998), Mary Baker Eddy, Reading: Perseus Books, ISBN#0-7382-004. 

Quimby was steeped both in the Protestant Christianity of his time and the science of the industrial revolution. Quimby wrote in 1864, "The wise man, in like measure... knows that the light of the body or natural man is but the reflection of the scientific man. Our misery lies in this darkness. This is the prison that holds the natural man, till the light of Wisdom bursts his bonds, and lets the captive free. Here is where Christ went to preach to the prisoners bound by error before the reformation of science." Quimby writes many such passages linking the healing power of Christ with right perception and understanding, which Quimby equates with Science. The impartial student may see Quimby as a precursor in the theory and practice of Christian Science, though Eddy's relationship with Quimby was a subject of controversy even within her own lifetime. REFERENCES: Quimby papers, Library of Congress, Vol. 6., p. . This corrects the edited version in Horatio Dresser, The Quimby Manuscripts, … In a letter to the Portland Evening Courier November 1862, Eddy wrote:

Eddy wrote that she had a relief from pain after visiting Quimby and even his absent treatments were effective as she claimed to draw on his spiritual presence, claiming even visitations by his apparition. In a letter in 1864 Eddy wrote that "I am up and about today, i.e., by the help of the Lord (Quimby)." Powell, Lyman. 1917. Christian science, the faith and its founder. G.P. Putnam's sons, p. 31 

In another letter to the Portland Courier Eddy denied mesmerism, claiming Christ was the cure:

While Quimby had his own notions on the nature of these unseen forces, which Eddy accepted early on, she would later draw decidedly different opinions on the nature of thought on the body and reject any form of hypnotism. It is evident that Eddy and Quimby worked together, appreciated one another and learned from one another. Quimby later said he learned more from Eddy than she did from him. Eddy clearly respected him and at one point referred to him as an "advanced thinker" with a "high and noble character." Notes: Peel (1971, p. 172 & 183) REFERENCES: Peel, Robert (1972) Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery, Boston: The Christian Science Publishing Society, ISBN#0-87510-085-6. 

Still, the controversy over how much Eddy took from Quimby and vice versa has existed from their day to the present. Quimby's work and writings, as seen above, included references to "Christ" and "scientific man" and "wisdom," all words which Eddy used in her writings and teachings. However, it is clear, based on scholarly work on this subject (see, for example, the Gillian Gill and Robert Peel biographies of Eddy), that Quimby continued to practice various forms of hypnotism, mesmerism, and physical manipulation of the body. In contrast, Eddy's healing method became firmly grounded in The Bible and the healing example of Jesus before the first edition of her book Science and Health was published in 1875. Notes: Gill (1998, p. 168), Peel (1972, Chapter 6) REFERENCES Gill, Gillian (1998), Mary Baker Eddy, Reading: Perseus Books, ISBN#0-7382-004; Peel, Robert (1972) Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery, Boston: The Christian Science Publishing Society, ISBN#0-87510-085-6. 

Phineas Quimby died in January 1866.

==1866 injury, healing and study leads to Christian Science==
In February 1866, after a fall in Lynn, Massachusetts caused a spinal injury, Eddy said she experienced a healing. She is quoted saying: 

She later filed a claim for money from the city of Lynn for her injury on the grounds that she was "still suffering from the effects of that fall" (though she afterwards withdrew the lawsuit). Gillian Gill writes that Eddy's claim was probably made under financial pressure from her husband at the time. Her neighbors believed her sudden recovery to be a near-miracle. Gill 1999, pp. 161-170. Mary's attending physician Alvin M. Cushing, a homeopath, testified under oath that he "did not at any time declare, or believe, that there was no hope for Mrs. Patterson's recovery, or that she was in critical condition." 

She devoted the next three years of her life to Biblical study and what she considered the discovery of Christian Science. In her autobiography, Retrospection and Introspection, Eddy writes "I then withdrew from society about three years,--to ponder my mission, to search the Scriptures, to find the Science of Mind that should take the things of God and show them to the creature, and reveal the great curative Principle, --Deity." 

Convinced by her own study of the Bible, especially Genesis 1, and through experimentation, Eddy claimed to have found healing power through a higher sense of God as Spirit and man as God's spiritual "image and likeness." She became convinced that illness could be healed through an awakened thought brought about by a clearer perception of God and the explicit rejection of drugs, hygiene and medicine based upon the observation that Jesus did not use these methods for healing: It is plain that God does not employ drugs or hygiene, nor provide them for human use; else Jesus would have recommended and employed them in his healing. … The tender word and Christian encouragement of an invalid, pitiful patience with his fears and the removal of them, are better than hecatombs of gushing theories, stereotyped borrowed speeches, and the doling of arguments, which are but so many parodies on legitimate Christian Science, aflame with divine Love. (Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, 143:5, 367:3) She eventually called this spiritual perception the operation of the Christ, Truth on human consciousness.

Claiming to have first healed herself and then others, and having learned from these experiences, Eddy felt anyone could perceive what she called "the Kingdom of Heaven" or spiritual reality on earth. For her, this healing method was based on scientific principles and could be taught to others. This positive rule of healing, she taught, resulted from a new understanding of God as infinite Spirit beyond the limitations of the material senses.

==Divorce, publishing her work==
In 1873, Eddy divorced Daniel Patterson for adultery. She stayed at various houses of spiritualists, often leaving in violent exchanges with her hostesses.

In 1875, after several years of offering her healing method, Eddy published her work in a book entitled Science and Health (years later retitled Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures), which she called the textbook of Christian Science. The first publication run was one thousand copies, which she self-published. In the final edition, she wrote "In the year 1866, I discovered the Christ Science or divine laws of Life, Truth, and Love, and named my discovery Christian Science" (p. 107). During these years she taught what she considered the science of "primitive Christianity" to at least 800 people.

Many of her students became healers themselves. The last 100 pages of Science and Health (chapter entitled "Fruitage") contains testimonies of people who claimed to have been healed by reading her book. She made numerous revisions to her book from the time of its first publication until shortly before her death.

In 1877 she married Asa Gilbert Eddy; in 1882 they moved to Boston, and he died that year. Mary Baker Eddy Timeline 

==Accusations of plagiarism==

===Quimbyism===
Phineas Quimby by 1859 had connected his healing practices with the Christ of the New Testament. He also called his method of healing the "science of health", the "science of Christ" and had used the term "Christian Science" to describe his work. Martin, Walter. 2003. The Kingdom of the Cults. Bethany House Publishers, p. 151 According to the historian of science James C. Whorton:

Because of these facts and other considerations various writers such as Georgine Milmine and Martin Gardner have written that Eddy took many of her ideas from Quimby without giving him any kind of credit. Todd Jay Leonard summarized the controversy:

In the end, Eddy's conclusions from scriptural study and continued healing practice were different than the Quimby teachings. Eddy also eventually rejected many of Quimby's conclusions on the dynamics of human disease, suffering, healing, redemption, God and Christ. Through her study of the Bible, Eddy rejected Quimby's notion of a dualism between matter and spirit. She wrote in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, "All is infinite Mind and its infinite manifestation, for God is All-in-all. Spirit is immortal Truth; matter is mortal error." (S&H 468: 10–12)

Eddy found that while at first hypnotism seemed to benefit the patient, it later created more problems than the original sickness. Ultimately she rejected any form of hypnotism or mesmerism, stating 

Eddy's use of these terms and her teaching are considered by both her defenders and Quimby's family to be distinct from Quimbyism. Quimby's son, George, wrote, "Don't confuse his method of healing with Mrs. Eddy's Christian Science, so far as her religious teachings go.... The religion which she teaches certainly is hers, for which I cannot be too thankful." Gottschalk, Stephen. 2011. Rolling Away the Stone: Mary Baker Eddy's Challenge to Materialism. Indiana University Press, p. 72 

===Hinduism===
In the 24th edition of her book Science and Health up to the 33rd edition, Eddy admitted the harmony between Vedanta philosophy and Christian Science. She also quoted certain passages from an English translation of the Bhagavad Gita but they were later removed. According to Gillian Gill, in the 1891 revision, Eddy removed from her book all the trendy references to Eastern religion which her editor, Reverend James Henry Wiggin, had introduced. Gill, Gillian. Mary Baker Eddy. Perseus Books, 1998, p. 332-33. On this issue Swami Abhedananda wrote:

Other Hindu writers such as Jyotirmayananda Saraswati have said that Eddy may have been influenced by ancient Hindu philosophy. Nanda, Maya. 1993.Vivekananda: His Gospel of Man-making with a Garland of Tributes and a Chronicle of his Life and Times, wih Pictures. Swami Jyotirmayananda, p. 480 The historian Damodar Singhal wrote:

Swami Yogananda in his 1926 article entitled "Christian Science and Hindu Philosophy" wrote "It may be of much interest to many Christian Scientists to learn that the great founder of their faith, Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy was a student of the Hindu Scriptures". Christian Science And Hindu Philosophy Wendell Thomas in his scholarly work Hinduism Invades America (1930) supported the conclusion of Yogananda and suggested that Eddy may have discovered Hinduism through the teachings of the New England Transcendentalists such as Bronson Alcott who had met Eddy. Thomas, Wendell. 1930. Hinduism Invades America. The Beacon Press, Inc., pp. 228-234 Online 

Stephen Gottschalk, however, in his book The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life (1973) wrote:

Timothy Miller wrote that Eddy's writings show a strong resemblance to the Hindu philosophy Advaita Vedanta. Miller, Timothy. 1995. America's Alternative Religions. State University of New York, p. 174 

==Building a church==
Mary Baker G. Eddy in later years.
Eddy devoted the rest of her life to the establishment of the church, writing its bylaws, The Manual of The Mother Church, and revising Science and Health. While Eddy was a highly controversial religious leader, author, and lecturer, thousands of people flocked to her teachings.

By the 1870s Mary was telling her students "Some day I will have a church of my own." NOTES: Peel (1971, p. 62) REFERENCES: Peel, Robert (1971), Mary Baker Eddy, The Years of Trial, Boston: The Christian Science Publishing Society, ISBN#0-87510-118-16 In 1879 she and her students established the Church of Christ, Scientist, "to commemorate the word and works of our Master , which should reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing." NOTES: Eddy (1910, pp. 17-18) REFERENCES: Eddy, Mary Baker (1910), Church Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Mass, Boston: The First Church of Christ, Scientist. In 1892 at Eddy's direction, the church reorganized as The First Church of Christ, Scientist, "designed to be built on the Rock, Christ...." NOTES: Eddy (1910, pp. 18-19) REFERENCES: Eddy, Mary Baker (1910), Church Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Mass, Boston: The First Church of Christ, Scientist. Some years later in 1881, she founded the Massachusetts Metaphysical College, NOTES: Peel (1971, pp. 81-82) REFERENCES: Peel, Robert (1971), Mary Baker Eddy, The Years of Trial, Boston: The Christian Science Publishing Society, ISBN#0-87510-118-16 where she taught approximately 800 students in Boston, Massachusetts between the years 1882 and 1889.

This was a large sum for the period and generated considerable controversy. Caplan, Eric. 2001. Mind Games: American Culture and the Birth of Psychotherapy. University of California Press, p. 75 

Her students spread across the country practicing healing, and instructing others, in accordance with Eddy's teachings. Eddy authorized these students to list themselves as Christian Science Practitioners in the church's periodical, The Christian Science Journal. She also founded the Christian Science Sentinel, a weekly magazine with articles about how to heal and testimonies of healing.

As teacher, author, and preacher, Eddy was leader of the burgeoning Christian Science movement. In 1888, a reading room selling Bibles, her writings and other publications opened in Boston. A New Home," The Christian Science Journal (September 1888), p. 317. This model would soon be replicated, and branch churches worldwide maintain more than 1,200 Christian Science Reading Rooms today. See Christian Science Reading Room listings in current edition of the Christian Science Journal. 

In 1889, she closed the Massachusetts Metaphysical College to focus on a major revision of Science and Health.

==Malicious animal magnetism==
The converse of mental healing was the use of mental powers to destroy people's health – what Eddy termed "malicious animal magnetism." She was concerned that a new practitioner could inadvertently harm a patient through unenlightened use of their mental powers, and that less scrupulous individuals could use such powers as a weapon. Moore, Laurence. Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans. Oxford University Press, 1986. 

In 1872 Eddy had an argument with her first student Richard Kennedy and he was expelled from Christian Science. Later she came to believe out of revenge that he was using mental powers to destroy her so Eddy ordered her students to "mobilize all their mental energy to combat him". Tucker, Ruth A. Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement, p. 157. Eddy also ordered her students to stand outside her bedroom door to protect her from any mental attacks directed at her. In 1882 Eddy publicly claimed that her last husband, Asa Gilbert Eddy had died of "mental assassination". Miller, Timothy. America's Alternative Religions. State University of New York, 1995, p. 62. Daniel Spofford was another Christian Scientist expelled due to the accusation of practicing malicious animal magnetism by Eddy. Haller, John S. American Medicine in Transition, 1840-1910, p. 139. According to Eugene V. Gallagher:

There is no scientific evidence for the existence of "malicious animal magnetism" but the belief "remains a part of the doctrine of Christian Science". Williams, William. Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy. Facts on File, 2000. In an article entitled "Malicious Animal Magnetism" published in the Christian Science Journal for February 1889 Eddy wrote that mental assassination was one of the greatest crimes and that anyone practicing it should be put to death by a human executioner (capital punishment). Religio-Medical Masquerade by Frederick W. Peabody Several persons had committed suicide because of the fear of malicious animal magnetism. Locke, Charles. 1911. Eddyism: Is it Christian? Is it Scientific? How Long Will it Last?. Grafton Publishing Company, p. 39 Mary Tomlinson, a student of Mary Baker Eddy, committed suicide by throwing herself out of a window. Dakin, Edwin. 1930. Mrs. Eddy: the biography of a virginal mind. Blue Ribbon Books, p. 462 Another Christian Scientist Marion Stephens committed suicide by gassing herself in a bathroom. Lay Eddyite Suicide to "Death Thought". Malicious Animal Magnetism" Said to Have Caused Miss Stephens to End Her Life. 

In her later years, Eddy apparently became paranoid, believing that 50,000 people were trying to kill her by projecting their evil thoughts. Bates, E.S. & Dittmore, J.V. 1933. Mary Baker Eddy. The Truth and the Tradition George Routlege and Sons, London. Eddy wrote that if she died it would be due to malicious animal magnetism rather than from natural causes. Tucker, Ruth. Another Gospel: Cults, Alternative Religions, and the New Age Movement. Zondervan, 2004, p. 166. 

==Mark Twain==
Mark Twain was a notable critic of Eddy.
In 1907 Mark Twain published a satirical diatribe attacking Eddy, entitled Christian Science. He wrote:

When Harper's refused to publish an earlier essay of his on Christian Science in 1903, Twain interpreted the rejection as suppression caused by pressure from Christian Scientists and wrote, "The situation is not barren of humour. I had been doing my best to show in print that the Xn Scientist cult has become a power in the land – well, here is the proof: it has scared the biggest publisher in the Union." Reasonings: The Official Newsletter of Rationalists of Greater Madison, a Chapter of the Freedom from Religion Foundation, Issues 1-66, The Rationalists, 1989, p. 47 

Twain later offered another appraisal of Eddy, reported by his biographer Albert Bigelow Paine: 

==Use of medicine==
Calvin Frye, Eddy's personal secretary
A diary kept by Calvin Frye, Eddy's personal secretary, suggested that Eddy had a lifelong dependence on morphine. Gardner, Martin. 1993. The Healing Revelations of Mary Baker Eddy. Prometheus Books. Miranda Rice, a friend and close student of Eddy, told a newspaper in 1906: "I know that Mrs. Eddy was addicted to morphine in the seventies. She begged me to get some for her. She sent her husband Mr. Eddy for some, and when he failed to get it went herself and got it. She locked herself into her room and for two days excluded every one. She was a slave to morphine." Springer, Fleta. 1930. According to the Flesh: A Biography of Mary Baker Eddy. Coward-McCann, inc., p. 299 Biographer Gillian Gill notes that the prescription of morphine was normal medical practice at the time, and that in her view Eddy was at no time addicted. Gillian Gill, Mary Baker Eddy, Radcliffe Biography Series, MA: Merloyd Lawrence / Perseus Books, p. 546 

Eddy had her grandchildren vaccinated and also paid for a mastectomy for her sister-in-law. Whorton, James. 2004. Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America. Oxford University Press, p. 128 Eddy was quoted in the New York Herald: "Where vaccination is compulsory, let your children be vaccinated, and see that your mind is in such a state that by your prayers vaccination will do the children no harm. So long as Christian Scientists obey the laws, I do not suppose their mental reservations will be thought to matter much." New York Herald, May 1, 1901, reprinted in Eddy, Mary Baker, "General Miscellany," Prose Works other than Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Trustees under the Will of Mary Baker G. Eddy, pp. 344-345 

By 1897, Eddy had used glasses for some years only for very fine print but later she dispensed with them almost entirely. Peel, Robert. Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Authority. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1977, pp. 108-09, 411, note 65. She found she could read fine print with ease. Peel, Robert. Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Trial. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1971, p. 376. In 1907, Arthur Brisbane, who was known as the greatest journalist of his day, "The Press: Death of Brisbane," Time, January 4, 1937. and who was not a believer in Christian Science, interviewed Eddy. Brisbane, Arthur. "An Interview with Mrs. Eddy," Cosmopolitan Magazine, August 1907, p. 451. At one point, he picked up a periodical, selected at random a paragraph, and asked Eddy to read it. Brisbane, Arthur. "An Interview with Mrs. Eddy," Cosmopolitan Magazine, August 1907, pp. 454, 456. According to Brisbane, at the age of eighty six she read the ordinary magazine type without glasses, as readily as any woman of twenty-five could do. Brisbane, Arthur. "An Interview with Mrs. Eddy," Cosmopolitan Magazine, August 1907, p. 456. Towards the end of her life Eddy wore glasses and was frequently attended by doctors, these things acted in direct contradiction to the tenets of her own religion, in the view of critics. Stark, Rodney. The Rise and Fall of Christian Science. J. Contemporary Religion 13 (2) (1998), 189-214. On this subject Walter Martin in his book Kingdom of the Cults (2003) wrote:

==Psychological evaluation==
In 1907, in the course of a legal case, four psychiatrists interviewed the 86 year old Eddy. They found that she was sane. One of them, Dr. Allan McLane Hamilton (1848–1919), told The New York Times that the attacks on Eddy were the result of "a spirit of religious persecution that has at last quite overreached itself," and that "there seems to be a manifest injustice in taxing so excellent and capable an old lady as Mrs. Eddy with any form of insanity." The New York Times 1907. The psychiatrist George Eman Vaillant wrote that Eddy had once been hypochrondriacal. Vaillant, George. 1992. Ego Mechanisms of Defense: A Guide for Clinicans and Researchers. American Psychiatric Press, Inc., p. 70 The psychologists Leon Joseph Saul and Silas L. Warner in their book The Psychotic Personality (1982) came to the conclusion that Eddy had diagnostic characteristics of Psychotic Personality Disorder (PPD). Saul, Leon and Warner, Silas. 1982. The Psychotic Personality. Van Nostrand Reinhold, pp. 287-288 

==Death==
 Mary Baker Eddy's burial Memorial
Eddy died on the evening of December 3, 1910 at her home at 400 Beacon Street, in the Chestnut Hill section of Newton, Massachusetts. Her death was announced the next morning, when a city medical examiner was called in. She was buried December 8, 1910 at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her memorial was designed by New York architect Egerton Swartwout. Hundreds of tributes appeared in newspapers around the world, including The Boston Globe, which wrote, "She did a wonderful—an extraordinary work in the world and there is no doubt that she was a powerful influence for good." "Mrs. Eddy's Life and Achievement." The Boston Globe, December 5, 1910, p. 4. 

==Legacy==
Today, there are almost 1,700 Christian Science churches in 76 countries. See Christian Science Church listings in current issue of The Christian Science Journal. 

Eddy's book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures has been a best seller for decades, and was selected as one of the "75 Books By Women Whose Words Have Changed The World," by the Women's National Book Association. 75 Books by Women Whose Words Have Changed the World In 1995, Eddy was inducted in the National Women's Hall of Fame. National Women's Hall of Fame: Mary Baker Eddy In 2002, The Mary Baker Eddy Library opened its doors, giving the public access to one of the largest collections about an American woman. The Mary Baker Eddy Library 

For more than a century, The Christian Science Journal and the Christian Science Sentinel have been publishing accounts of restored health based on the system of care that Eddy taught. The Christian Science Monitor newspaper has won seven Pulitzer Prizes to date. The Pulitzer Prizes 

In 1921, on the 100th anniversary of Eddy's birth, a 100-ton (in rough) and 60–70 tons (hewn), eleven-foot square granite pyramid was dedicated on the site of her birthplace in Bow, New Hampshire. A gift from James F. Lord, it was later dynamited in 1962 by order of the church's board of directors. 
Also demolished was Eddy's former home in Pleasant View, as the board feared that it was becoming a place of pilgrimage. Although Eddy allowed personal praise in her lifetime for various reasons, including for publicity and fundraising, the church shuns both the cult of personality and religious reliquaries.

* Willa Cather and Georgine Milmine The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science (1909) began as a famous magazine series in McClure's, 1907–08; the book was republished in 1971, and again in 1993 by the University of Nebraska Press.
* Doris and Moris Grekel also wrote three-part non church-authorized biography on Eddy, The Discovery of the Science of Man: (1821–1888), (ISBN 1-893107-23-X), The Founding of Christian Science: The Life of Mary Baker Eddy 1888–1900, (ISBN 1-893107-24-8), and The Forever Leader: (1901–1910) (ISBN 0-9645803-8-1). This biography was aimed at serious students of Christian Science as opposed to the general public.
* Former Church treasurer and clerk, John V. Dittemore teamed up with Ernest Sutherland Bates, in 1932, to write a biography, Mary Baker Eddy – The Truth and the Tradition. Most of the prose was written by Bates and Dittemore would later distance himself from the book. It has some genuinely distinct information including a list of Eddy's students taught at the Massachusetts Metaphysical College.
* The famous Viennese novelist Stefan Zweig wrote a biography The Mental Healers: Mesmer, Freud, Mary Baker Eddy. Original in German: Die Heilung durch den Geist: Mesmer, Freud, Mary Baker Eddy. Zweig based his book solely on the Milmine biography (above) and after consultation with Sigmund Freud, concluded that Eddy was a madwoman.
