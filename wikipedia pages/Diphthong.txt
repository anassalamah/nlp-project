[[Diphthong]]

A diphthong ( or ; Greek: , diphthongos, literally "two sounds" or "two tones"), also known as a gliding vowel, refers to two adjacent vowel sounds occurring within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. For most dialects of English, the phrase "no highway cowboys" contains five distinct diphthongs.

Diphthongs contrast with monophthongs, where the tongue or other speech organs do not move significantly and the syllable contains only a single vowel sound. Where two adjacent vowel sounds occur in different syllables—for example, in the English word re-elect—the result is described as hiatus, not as a diphthong.

Diphthongs often form when separate vowels are run together in rapid speech during a conversation. However, there are also unitary diphthongs, as in the English examples above, which are heard by listeners as single-vowel sounds (phonemes). definition of 'Diphthong' on SIL International, accessed 17 January 2008 

==International Phonetic Alphabet==
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, monophthongs are transcribed with one symbol, as in English sun . Diphthongs are transcribed with two letters, as in English sign or sane . The two vowel symbols are chosen to represent the beginning and ending positions of the tongue, though this can be only approximate.

The non-syllabic diacritic (the inverted breve below: ) FileFormat.Info, page on combining inverted breve below can be placed under the less prominent component to show that it is part of a diphthong rather than a separate vowel. It is, however, usually omitted in languages such as English, where there is not likely to be any confusion.

Without the diacritic, the sequence can represent either a diphthong () or two vowels in hiatus ().

==Types==

===Falling and rising===
Falling (or descending) diphthongs start with a vowel quality of higher prominence (higher pitch or volume) and end in a semivowel with less prominence, like in eye, while rising (or ascending) diphthongs begin with a less prominent semivowel and end with a more prominent full vowel, similar to the in yard. (Note that "falling" and "rising" in this context do not refer to vowel height; for that, the terms "opening" and "closing" are used instead. See below.) The less prominent component in the diphthong may also be transcribed as an approximant, thus in eye and in yard. However, when the diphthong is analysed as a single phoneme, both elements are often transcribed with vowel letters (, ). Note also that semivowels and approximants are not equivalent in all treatments, and in the English and Italian languages, among others, many phoneticians do not consider rising combinations to be diphthongs, but rather sequences of approximant and vowel. There are many languages (such as Romanian) that contrast one or more rising diphthongs with similar sequences of a glide and a vowel in their phonetic inventory (see semivowel for examples).

===Closing, opening, and centering===
In closing diphthongs, the second element is more close than the first (e.g. ); in opening diphthongs, the second element is more open (e.g. ). Closing diphthongs tend to be falling (), and opening diphthongs are generally rising (), as open vowels are more sonorous and therefore tend to be more prominent. However, exceptions to this rule are not rare in the world's languages. In Finnish, for instance, the opening diphthongs and are true falling diphthongs, since they begin louder and with higher pitch and fall in prominence during the diphthong.

A third, rare type of diphthong that is neither opening nor closing is height-harmonic diphthongs, with both elements at the same vowel height. These were particularly characteristic of Old English, which had diphthongs such as , .

A centering diphthong is one that begins with a more peripheral vowel and ends with a more central one, such as , , and in Received Pronunciation or and in Irish. Many centering diphthongs are also opening diphthongs (, ).

Diphthongs may contrast in how far they open or close. For example, Samoan contrasts low-to-mid with low-to-high diphthongs:
* ’ai 'probably'
* ’ae 'but'
* ’auro 'gold'
* ao 'a cloud'

===Length===
Languages differ in the length of diphthongs, measured in terms of morae. In languages with phonemically short and long vowels, diphthongs typically behave like long vowels, and are pronounced with a similar length. In languages with only one phonemic length for pure vowels, however, diphthongs may behave like pure vowels. For example, in Icelandic, both monophthongs and diphthongs are pronounced long before single consonants and short before most consonant clusters.

Some languages contrast short and long diphthongs. In some languages, such as Old English, these behave like short and long vowels, occupying one and two morae, respectively. In other languages, however, such as Ancient Greek, they occupy two and three morae, respectively, with the first element rather than the diphthong as a whole behaving as a short or long vowel. Languages that contrast three quantities in diphthongs are extremely rare, but not unheard of; Northern Sami is known to contrast long, short and "finally stressed" diphthongs, the last of which are distinguished by a long second element.

==Difference from a vowel and semivowel==

While there are a number of similarities, diphthongs are not the same as a combination of a vowel and an approximant or glide. Most importantly, diphthongs are fully contained in the syllable nucleus while a semivowel or glide is restricted to the syllable boundaries (either the onset or the coda). This often manifests itself phonetically by a greater degree of constriction. though this phonetic distinction is not always clear. The English word yes, for example, consists of a palatal glide followed by a monophthong rather than a rising diphthong. In addition, the segmental elements must be different in diphthongs so that , when it occurs in a language, does not contrast with though it is possible for languages to contrast and .

====German====

=====Standard German=====
Phonemic diphthongs in German:
* as in Ei ‘egg’
* as in Maus ‘mouse’
* as in neu ‘new’

In the varieties of German that vocalize the in the syllable coda, other diphthongal combinations may occur. These are only phonetic diphthongs, not phonemic diphthongs, since the vocalic pronunciation alternates with consonantal pronunciations of if a vowel follows, cf. du hörst ‘you hear’ – ich höre ‘I hear’. These phonetic diphthongs may be as follows:
* as in er ‘he’
* as in ihr ‘you (plural)’
* as in Ohr ‘ear’
* as in Öhr ‘eye (hole in a needle)’
* as in Uhr ‘clock’
* as in Tür ‘door’
* as in wahr ‘true’

=====Bernese German=====
The diphthongs of some German dialects differ a lot from standard German diphthongs. The Bernese German diphthongs, for instance, correspond rather to the Middle High German diphthongs than to standard German diphthongs:
* as in lieb ‘dear’
* as in guet ‘good’
* as in müed ‘tired’
* as in Bei ‘leg’
* as in Boum ‘tree’
* as in Böim ‘trees’

Apart from these phonemic diphthongs, Bernese German has numerous phonetic diphthongs due to L-vocalization in the syllable coda, for instance the following ones:
* as in Stau ‘stable’
* as in Staau ‘steel’
* as in Wäut ‘world’
* as in wääut ‘elects’
* as in tschúud ‘guilty’

==== Yiddish ====
Yiddish has three diphthongs: 
* as in פּליטה ('refugee' f.)
* as in נײַן ('nine')
* as in אופֿן ('way')

Diphthongs may reach a higher target position (towards ) in situations of coarticulatory phenomena or when words with such vowels are being emphasized.

====Norwegian====
There are five diphthongs in Norwegian:

* as in nei, "no"
* as in øy, "island"
* as in sau, "sheep"
* as in hai, "shark"
* as in joik, "Sami song"

An additional diphthong, , occurs only in the word hui in the expression i hui og hast "in great haste". The number and form of diphthongs vary between dialects.

====Faroese====
Diphthongs in Faroese are:
* as in bein (can also be short)
* as in havn
* as in har, mær
* as in hey
* as in nevnd
* as in nøvn
* as in hús
* as in mín, bý, ið (can also be short)
* as in ráð
* as in hoyra (can also be short)
* as in sól, ovn

====Icelandic====
Diphthongs in Icelandic are the following:
* as in átta, "eight"
* as in nóg, "enough"
* as in auga, "eye"
* as in kær, "dear"
* as in þeir, "they"

Combinations of semivowel and a vowel are the following:
* as in éta, "eat"
* as in jata, "manger"
* as in já, "yes"
* as in joð, "iodine," "jay," "yod" (only in a handful of words of foreign origin)
* as in jól, "Christmas"
* as in jötunn, "giant"
* as in jæja, "oh well"

===Romance languages===

====French====
In French, , , and may be considered true diphthongs (that is, fully contained in the syllable nucleus: ). Other sequences are considered part of a glide formation process that turns a high vowel into a semivowel (and part of the syllable onset) when followed by another vowel. 

Diphthongs
* as in roi "king"
* as in groin "muzzle"
* as in huit "eight"

Semivowels
* as in oui "yes"
* as in lien "bond"
* as in Ariège
* as in travail "work"
* as in Marseille
* as in feuille "leaf"
* as in grenouille "frog"
* as in vieux "old"

=====Quebec French=====

In Quebec French, long vowels are normally diphthongized in informal speech when stressed.

* as in tard "late"
* as in père "father"
* as in fleur "flower"
* as in autre "other"
* as in neutre "neutral"

====Catalan====
Catalan possesses a number of phonetic diphthongs, all of which begin (rising diphthongs) or end (falling diphthongs) in or . 

+Catalan diphthongs 
 falling 
 aigua 'water' taula 'table' 
 mainada 'children' caurem 'we will fall' 
 remei 'remedy' peu 'foot' 
 rei 'king' seu 'his/her' 
 niu 'nest' 
 noi 'boy' nou 'new' 
 jou 'yoke' 
 avui 'today' duu 'he/she is carrying' 
 rising 
 iaia 'grandma' quatre 'four' 
 veiem 'we see' seqüència 'sequence' 
 seient 'seat' ungüent 'ointment' 
 feia 'he/she was doing' qüestió 'question' 
 pingüí 'penguin' 
 iode 'iodine' quota 'payment' 
 iogurt 'yoghurt' 

In standard Eastern Catalan, rising diphthongs (that is, those starting with or ) are only possible in the following contexts: Institut d'Estudis Catalans Els diftongs, els triftongs i els hiats – Gramàtica de la Llengua Catalana (provisional draft) 
* in word initial position, e.g. iogurt.
* Both occur between vowels as in feia and veiem.
* In the sequences or and vowel, e.g. guant, quota, qüestió, pingüí (these exceptional cases even lead some scholars e.g. , to hypothesize the existence of rare labiovelar phonemes and ). 

There are also certain instances of compensatory diphthongization in the Majorcan dialect so that ('logs') (in addition to deleting the palatal plosive) develops a compensating palatal glide and surfaces as (and contrasts with the unpluralized ). Diphthongization compensates for the loss of the palatal stop (part of Catalan's segment loss compensation). There are other cases where diphthongization compensates for the loss of point of articulation features (property loss compensation) as in ('year') vs ('years'). The dialectal distribution of this compensatory diphthongization is almost entirely dependent on the dorsal plosive (whether it is velar or palatal) and the extent of consonant assimilation (whether or not it is extended to palatals). 

====Portuguese====

The Portuguese diphthongs are formed by the labio-velar approximant and palatal approximant with a vowel, European Portuguese has 14 phonemic diphthongs (10 oral and 4 nasal), all of which are falling diphthongs formed by a vowel and a nonsyllabic high vowel. Brazilian Portuguese has roughly the same amount, although the European and non-European dialects have slightly different pronunciations ( is a distinctive feature of some southern and central Portuguese dialects, especially that of Lisbon). A onglide after or and before all vowels as in quando ('when') or guarda ('guard') may also form rising diphthongs and triphthongs. Additionally, in casual speech, adjacent heterosyllabic vowels may combine into diphthongs and triphthongs or even sequences of them.

In addition, phonetic diphthongs are formed in most Brazilian Portuguese dialects by the vocalization of in the syllable coda with words like sol ('sun') and sul ('south') as well as by yodization of vowels preceding or its allophone at syllable coda in terms like arroz ('rice'), and (or ) in terms such as paz mundial ('world peace') and dez anos ('ten years').

====Spanish====
Phonemically, Spanish has seven falling diphthongs and eight rising diphthongs. In addition, during fast speech, sequences of vowels in hiatus become diphthongs wherein one becomes non-syllabic (unless they are the same vowel, in which case they fuse together) as in poeta ('poet') and maestro ('teacher'). The Spanish diphthongs are: 

 Spanish diphthongs falling 
 aire 'air' pausa 'pause' 
 rey 'king' neutro 'neutral' 
 hoy 'today' bou 'seine fishing' 
 muy 'very' 
 rising 
 hacia 'towards' cuadro 'picture' 
 tierra 'earth' fuego 'fire' 
 fuimos 'we went' 
 radio 'radio' cuota 'quota' 
 viuda 'widow' 

====Italian====
The diphthongs of Italian are: 

+Italian diphthongs falling 
 baita 'mountain hut' auto 'car' 
 potei 'I could' (past tense) pleurite 'pleurisy' 
 sei 'six' neutro 'neuter' 
 poi 'later' 
 voi 'you' (pl.) 
 lui 'he' 
 rising 
 chiave 'key' guado 'ford'

 soffietto 'bellows' quello 'that' 
 guida 'guide' 
 chiodo 'nail' quota 'quota' 
 fiore 'flower' acquoso 'watery' 
 piuma 'feather' 

In general, unstressed in hiatus can turn into glides in more rapid speech (e.g. biennale 'biennial'; coalizione 'coalition') with the process occurring more readily in syllables further from stress. 

====Romanian====

Romanian has two diphthongs: and . As a result of their origin (diphthongization of mid vowels under stress), they appear only in stressed syllables and make morphological alternations with the mid vowels and . To native speakers, they sound very similar to and respectively. There are no perfect minimal pairs to contrast and , and because doesn't appear in the final syllable of a prosodic word, there are no monosyllabic words with ; exceptions might include voal ('veil') and trotuar ('sidewalk'), though Ioana Chiţoran argues that these are best treated as containing glide-vowel sequences rather than diphthongs. In addition to these, the semivowels and can be combined (either before, after, or both) with most vowels, while this arguably See for a brief overview of the views regarding Romanian semivowels forms additional diphthongs and triphthongs, only and can follow an obstruent-liquid cluster such as in broască ('frog') and dreagă ('to mend'). implying that and are restricted to the syllable boundary and therefore, strictly speaking, do not form diphthongs.

*, spelled abh, amh, eabh, or eamh
*, spelled ia, iai
*, spelled ua, uai

====Scottish Gaelic====
There are 9 diphthongs in Scottish Gaelic. Group 1 occur anywhere (eu is usually before -m, e.g. Seumas). Group 2 are reflexes that occur before -ll, -m, -nn, -bh, -dh, -gh and -mh.

====Cornish====
The following diphthongs are used in the Standard Written Form of Cornish. Each diphthong is given with its Revived Middle Cornish (RMC) and Revived Late Cornish (RLC) pronunciation.

====Welsh====
Welsh is traditionally divided into Northern and Southern dialects. In the north, some diphthongs may be short or long according to regular vowel length rules but in the south they are always short (see Welsh phonology). Southern dialects tend to simplify diphthongs in speech (e.g. gwaith /gwaiθ/ is reduced to /gwaːθ/.

Graph North South Example 
 ae maen 'stone' 
 ai gwaith 'work' 
 au haul 'sun'* 
 aw mawr 'great' 
 ei gweithio 'work' (verb) 
 eu treulio 'spend' 
 ew tew 'fat' 
 ey teyrn 'king' 
 iw lliw 'colour' 
 oe moel 'bald' 
 oi troi 'turn' 
 ou cyffrous 'excited' 
 uw duw 'god' 
 wy pwyll 'sense' 
 yw llyw 'rudder' 

* The plural ending -au is reduced to /a/ in the north and /e/ in the south, e.g. cadau 'battles' is /ˈkada/ (north) or /ˈkade/ (south).

===Slavic languages===

====Serbo-Croatian====
*i(j)e, as in mlijeko Vjesnik Babić ne zagovara korijenski pravopis, nego traži da Hrvati ne piju mlijeko nego – mlieko 
is conventionally considered a diphthong. However, it is actually in hiatus or separated by a semivowel, .

Some Serbo-Croatian dialects also have uo, as in kuonj, ruod, uon whereas, in Standard Croatian and Serbian, these words are konj, rod, on.

====Czech====
There are three diphthongs in Czech:

* as in auto (almost exclusively in words of foreign origin)
* as in euro (in words of foreign origin only)
* as in koule

The vowel groups ia, ie, ii, io, and iu in foreign words are not regarded as diphthongs, they are pronounced with between the vowels .

===Finno-Ugric languages===

====Estonian====

All nine vowels can appear as the first component of an Estonian diphthong, but only occur as the second component.

There are additional diphthongs less commonly used, such as in Euroopa (Europe), in söandama (to dare), and in näuguma (to mew).

====Finnish====

All Finnish diphthongs are falling. Notably, Finnish has true opening diphthongs (e.g. ), which are not very common crosslinguistically compared to centering diphthongs (e.g. in English). Vowel combinations across syllables may in practice be pronounced as diphthongs, when an intervening consonant has elided, as in näön instead of for the genitive of näkö ('sight').

====Northern Sami====
The diphthong system in Northern Sami varies considerably from one dialect to another. The Western Finnmark dialects distinguish four different qualities of opening diphthongs:

* as in leat "to be"
* as in giella "language"
* as in boahtit "to come"
* as in vuodjat "to swim"

In terms of quantity, Northern Sami shows a three-way contrast between long, short and finally stressed diphthongs. The last are distinguished from long and short diphthongs by a markedly long and stressed second component. Diphthong quantity is not indicated in spelling.

====Mandarin Chinese====
Rising sequences in Mandarin are usually regarded as a combination of a medial semivowel () plus a vowel, while falling sequences are regarded as one diphthong.

*ai: , as in ài (愛, love)
*ei: , as in lèi (累, tired)
*ao: , as in dào (道, way)
*ou: , as in dòu (豆, bean)

However, the four rising sequences below can be considered diphthongs as they are analogous to respectively and the bare vowel nucleus mostly only occurs along with the corresponding medial.
*e: , as in hē (喝, to drink)
*ye/-: , as in xié (斜, tilted)
*wo/-uo: , as in wǒ (我, I)
*yue/-üe: , as in yuè (月, moon)
