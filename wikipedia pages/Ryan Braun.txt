[[Ryan Braun]]

Ryan Joseph Braun (born November 17, 1983) is an American baseball right fielder for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). Braun is considered a five-tool player for his ability to hit for power and average, his baserunning speed, and his excellent fielding and arm strength. He was ranked number seven by the Sporting News in its 2012 list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, and won the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2011.

Braun came under scrutiny for a disputed testosterone test that he failed in 2011, and then for his connection in 2012 to the Biogenesis of America clinic that allegedly provided performance-enhancing drugs to professional baseball players. After MLB's investigation following the Biogenesis scandal, on July 22, 2013, Braun was suspended without pay for the remainder of the 2013 season and playoffs (totaling 65 regular season games) for violating the league's drug policy. 

Braun is currently married to model Larisa Fraser.

He was a two-time all-area selection by the Los Angeles Times, and a three-time choice by the Los Angeles Daily News. As a senior, Braun was rated the sixth-best shortstop prospect in the country by Team One Baseball, and among the top 100 overall prospects by Baseball America.

==College career==
Offered baseball scholarships by Stanford and UC Berkeley, he instead attended the University of Miami on an academic scholarship, due to his excellent high school grades. He chose Miami for its academics, its athletics, and its social scene, noting: "I think the girls were the deal closer on the recruiting trip."

In 2007, Braun had what some sportswriters called one of the most dominant rookie seasons in baseball history. "Braun confident about move to left", Feuerherd, Vic, Wisconsin State Journal, March 4, 2008. Retrieved March 4, 2008. Called up on May 24 by the Brewers, he hit his first major league home run two nights later.

In mid-August, Yost moved Braun from third in the batting order to cleanup, switching him with Prince Fielder. The move was expected to allow Braun to steal more, as batting before Fielder was not conducive to him risking being thrown out on steal attempts. Additionally, successfully stealing a base would hypothetically allow opponents to intentionally walk Fielder and avoid pitching to him. "Sheets progresses, appears on target for Sept. 1 return" Semrau, Dennis, The Capital Times, August 15, 2007, accessed September 14, 2007 At the end of the month, however, Yost reverted to his previous batting order.

Braun was awarded the 2009 NL Outfielder Silver Slugger Award, winning it for the second year in a row. He became the first Brewer since Molitor, more than two decades prior, to win a Silver Slugger Award in consecutive years. Cecil Cooper is the only other Brewer to have done it. 

====2010: All Star and Silver Slugger====
Braun was named to Sporting News 2010 list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, ranking No. 22. 

He was elected a starting NL All Star outfielder for the third year in a row, in 2010. Braun led all major league outfielders in All Star votes for the third straight year, with 2,972,525, despite Milwaukee being the smallest media market in the majors. As in 2009, he received more votes than any NL players other than Pujols and Utley. He became the first Brewer to be a three-time All Star starter, passing Yount and Molitor. 

Braun was named NL Player of the Week for August 1–8, after leading the majors with a .538 batting average, 14 hits, and 8 runs scored, and notching a career-best 5-hit performance in one game. 

For the season, Braun was 2nd in the NL in hits (188) and doubles (45), 5th in total bases (310), 6th in runs (101), 7th in RBIs (103) and extra base hits (71), and 9th in batting average (.304). 

Braun hit the 8th-most home runs by any major leaguer through his first four seasons (128). He also became the fifth player in major league history to hit at least 125 homers with a .300 average over his first four seasons, joining Joe DiMaggio, Chuck Klein, Pujols, and Ted Williams. His 94 home runs in 2008–10 were the most by any right-handed outfielder. 

He was the first player in Brewers history to hit 20 or more home runs in each of his first four seasons, and the third Brewer to have 100 or more RBIs in three consecutive seasons (joining Richie Sexson (2001–03) and Prince Fielder (2007–09)). He also became the second player in Brewers history to have consecutive 100-RBI, 100-run seasons (joining Cecil Cooper, who did it in 1982–83). 

Braun was awarded the 2010 NL Outfielder Silver Slugger Award, winning it for the third year in a row. He became the second Brewer to win a Silver Slugger Award in three consecutive years, joining Cecil Cooper (1980–82). Robin Yount is the only other Brewer to have won the award three times (1980, 1982, and 1989). Braun was also voted to the 2010 NL Sporting News All Star Team, making the team for the third year in a row. 

====2011: NL MVP, All Star, Silver Slugger, and 30–30 club====
Braun in 2008
In 2011, Braun was again named to Sporting News list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, ranking No. 16. A panel of 21 MLB executives was polled to arrive at the list. 

He was named NL Player of the Month for April, after tying for the NL lead in home runs (10) and runs scored (24), while setting a new team record by reaching base in 28 consecutive games to start a season (erasing Yount's record of 23 games, set in 1983). He was also named NL Player of the Week, for the week ended April 25. 

He led all National League players in All Star balloting, with an NL-record 5.93 million votes, as he garnered more votes than any other NL outfielder for the fourth year in a row. He was voted an NL All Star starter for a franchise record fourth time. Braun had a 23-game hitting streak, the third-longest in team history. 

On August 31, he hit a ball deep to left-center field and tried for an inside-the-park home run, but fell on his way to home plate and was tagged out. The crowd gave him a standing ovation for his effort. 

On September 23, Braun hit a three-run, 450-foot home run that sealed the Brewers' NL-Central-clinching victory. He reflected that it was "eerily similar" to his home run on the last day of the 2008 season, also in the bottom of the eighth inning with the game tied 1–1, which enabled the Brewers to reach the postseason for the first time since 1982. Prince Fielder observed: "It's not new. That's what he does." 

He was named the NL Player of the Month for the fourth time in his career in September, after tying for second in the league with 8 home runs and 22 RBIs, while batting .330. 

Braun accepts his 2011 National League MVP award from 1989 American League winner Robin Yount.

On defense, he led all major league left fielders in fielding percentage, at .996. 

Braun became the 7th player to have at least four 30-homer, 100-RBI seasons in his first five years, joining Chuck Klein, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Ralph Kiner, Mark Teixeira, and Albert Pujols. He also became the 11th major leaguer to hit at least 30 home runs in four of his first five seasons. He joined Klein, DiMaggio, Williams, Kiner, Eddie Mathews, Frank Robinson, Mark McGwire, Teixeira, Pujols, and Dan Uggla. 

In 2011, Braun became the second Brewer (and 56th player in MLB history) to join the 30–30 club, joining Tommy Harper (1970). He was also the second player in Brewers' history to have two 20-steals/20-homers seasons, joining Corey Hart. He became the first Brewer to post three 100-run, 100-RBI seasons. In addition, he became one of three Brewers who have had four 100-RBI seasons, joining Cecil Cooper and Prince Fielder. 

Through 2011, he was third among active ballplayers in career slugging percentage (.563), behind Pujols and Alex Rodriguez, and first among left fielders in career fielding percentage (.994). He was also the Brewers' all-time leader in career batting average (.312), slugging percentage, and OPS (.933), and fourth in on-base percentage (.371). 

Braun accepting his 2011 Silver Slugger Award from Brewers owner Mark Attanasio
In the 2011 playoffs, through October 14 Braun set the major league postseason record by reaching base in the first inning in nine consecutive playoff games. He also tied Yount and Molitor for the Brewers' team record with his 22nd career postseason hit, and tied Charlie Moore for team's longest postseason hitting streak, at 7 games. In the postseason he led the Brewers with a .405 batting average, while driving in a team-best 10 RBIs. 

Braun was awarded the 2011 NL Outfielder Silver Slugger Award, winning it for the fourth year in a row. That set a Brewers team record, and he became the fourth NL outfielder to win the award four years in a row, joining Barry Bonds (who did it twice, from 1990 to 1994 and 2000 to 2004), Dale Murphy (1982–85), and Sammy Sosa (1998–2002). He was named the team's 2011 MVP in unanimous voting by the Milwaukee chapter of the BBWAA. 

On November 22, Braun was named the NL MVP award winner for the 2011 season, receiving 20 of 32 first place votes. 

====2012: All Star, Home Run Champion, Silver Slugger, 40–30 club====

On April 30, 2012, he became the first player to hit 3 home runs in one game at Petco Park. Braun was named to his fifth consecutive NL All-Star team as a reserve outfielder. It marked Braun's fifth All-Star honor, tying him with Cecil Cooper and Paul Molitor for the most in Brewers franchise history. On July 20, Braun had his 1,000th career hit. He accomplished the feat in his 815th game, sooner in his career than Pete Rose, the all-time hits leader, who did it in his 831st game.

On September 16, Braun hit his 200th career home run, against the New York Mets. In his following at bat, Braun hit another home run, his 40th of the year, the first time he had reached the 40-home-run mark.

In 2012, Braun led the National League in home runs (41), runs scored (108), total bases (356), and power-speed number (34.6), and led the league in OPS (.987) and extra-base hits (80) for the second consecutive year. He was 2nd in the NL in RBIs (112), slugging percentage (.595), and hits (191), 3rd in batting average (.319), 4th in on-base percentage (.391), and 9th in stolen bases (30). On defense, he led all NL left fielders in putouts (276) and in range factor/game (1.87). By driving in more than 100 runs in 2012 for the fifth consecutive year, Braun became the first player in Brewers history to have five 100-RBI seasons. Cecil Cooper and Prince Fielder each drove in 100 runs four times. Braun became the ninth player in major league history to have a season of 40 home runs and 30 stolen bases. Braun joins select crowd by notching 40/30 season 

Braun was awarded the 2012 NL Outfielder Silver Slugger Award, winning it for the fifth year in a row. Braun wins fifth straight Silver Slugger Award His five consecutive awards are the longest active streak in the major leagues. 

Braun finished second in National League MVP voting for 2012, behind Buster Posey.

====2013 season====
In 2013, Braun played in 61 games with a .298 batting average including 14 doubles, 9 home runs, and 38 RBIs in 225 at-bats. On July 22, 2013, Braun was suspended without pay for the remainder of the season for violations of the Basic Agreement and its Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. 

==Performance-enhancing drugs==

===Disputed testosterone test===
On December 10, 2011, a confidential urine test conducted in October 2011 was leaked to ESPN's Outside the Lines. They reported that Braun had tested positive for an elevated level of testosterone caused by a performance-enhancing drug and faced a 50-game suspension. The Daily News quoted a source who said that the test results were "insanely high, the highest ever for anyone who has ever taken a test, twice the level of the highest test ever taken". A second test conducted by an independent laboratory showed normal testosterone levels. Braun appealed the positive drug test in January 2012, and a three-member panel overturned the results on a 2-to-1 vote on February 22, 2012. It was the first time that a MLB player had successfully challenged a drug test result. The arbitration panel, consisting of MLB representative Rob Manfred, players' union lawyer Michael Weiner, and Shyam Das, determined that Braun had raised valid questions about the manner in which test collector Dino Laurenzi, Jr. had handled his sample. 

The New York Times wrote that Braun "won on a technicality". Braun's sample was collected and sealed on a Saturday. Laurenzi said that no FedEx delivery center was open, and he subsequently followed established protocol and stored the samples in a Rubbermaid container; he dropped the samples off to an open FedEx center on Monday. Braun, though, said there were at least five FedEx locations within 5 miles that were open until 9 p.m. and there also was a 24-hour location. MLB argued that there was no evidence of tampering of the sample, and the United States Anti-Doping Agency said the testosterone levels in the samples would not grow in a refrigerator over a weekend. MLB's drug-testing program states that the samples should be sent to the laboratory on the same day they are collected "absent unusual circumstance". 

===Links to Biogenesis clinic and MLB suspension===

In February 2013, Yahoo! Sports reported that Braun's name appeared three times in records of Biogenesis of America, a Coral Gables clinic alleged to have distributed performance-enhancing drugs to a number of Major League Baseball players who tested positive for banned substances. One entry noted that Braun owed the clinic between $20,000 and $30,000. Braun's name was not listed next to any specific PEDs, unlike some of the other players mentioned in the records. Braun released a statement maintaining that his attorneys had retained the clinic's operator, Anthony Bosch, as a consultant during his appeal of his positive drug test the previous season, and denied any further dealings with the clinic. 

Later that month, ESPN's Outside the Lines obtained a new Biogenesis document from April 2012 listing Braun among three other MLB players with the notation: "MLB Ryan Braun + 1500." An ESPN source said to be familiar with Bosch's operation claimed the list was of players who obtained PEDs from Bosch and their respective balances, with a circle around the plus sign next to a player's name indicating his balance was paid off. In late April, Bosch confirmed to ESPN that Braun's legal team merely consulted with him during Braun's appeal, and confirmed that he never spoke to Braun himself. 

On June 4, 2013, ESPN reported that MLB was preparing suspensions for players linked to using PEDs provided by Biogenesis of America, and its founder, Anthony Bosch. ESPN reported that Braun could have been suspended for as many as 100 games if found guilty, although the appeals process could take months and not yield a suspension until 2014. http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/9301536/major-league-baseball-suspend-18-players-including-alex-rodriguez-ryan-braun-part-miami-investigation 

On July 22, 2013, MLB suspended Braun for the remaining 65 games of the regular season, plus the entire postseason, for his involvement with the Biogenesis clinic. Braun, who will lose $3.25 million as a result, did not appeal the suspension. In a statement, he said, "I realize now that I have made some mistakes. I am willing to accept the consequences of those actions." ESPN reported that Braun decided to "strike a deal" with MLB after being presented with the evidence against him. "Ryan Braun suspended rest of year". espn.go.com. July 22, 2013. Retrieved July 22, 2013. Braun was the first superstar to be suspended for performance-enhancing drugs during the peak of his career. Called a "liar", he was heavily criticized by the media and other players, particularly for tarnishing Laurenzi's reputation. Passan, Jeff. "Ryan Braun doped, lied and cared only for himself". sports.yahoo.com. July 23, 2013. Retrieved July 31, 2013. Haudricourt, Tom. "Hard road lies ahead for Ryan Braun". Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. July 27, 2013. Retrieved July 31, 2013. In particular, it was later exposed that Braun engaged in a campaign for support from players around the league, accusing Laurenzi Jr. of being an anti-Semite. 

Although the standard suspension for a first offense under MLB's drug policy is 50 games, Braun was suspended an additional 15 games for his actions during and after his appeal of the 2011 test. According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, MLB officials were particularly angered by a speech Braun made during 2012 spring training in which he attacked Laurenzi's integrity and the integrity of the drug program as a whole. MLB considered Braun's speech, as well as his earlier attacks on Laurenzi, to be conduct detrimental to baseball—an offense punishable under the collective bargaining agreement, not the drug policy. Braun accepted the additional suspension without appeal because of overwhelming evidence in the Biogenesis case. Haudricourt, Tom. Ryan Braun suspension includes violation for basic agreement. Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, 2013-07-30. On August 22, Braun released a statement in which he apologized for using PEDs. "Ryan Braun apologizes for PED use". espn.go.com. August 23, 2013. Retrieved August 23, 2013. He admitted he used PED's during the later part of the 2011 season to nurse a nagging injury. The products he used were a cream and a lozenge that would expedite his rehabilitation.

===Civil Lawsuit===
On August 17, 2013 Braun was sued for fraud and defamation by Ralph Sasson, a former close friend with whom Braun attended middle school, high school, and college at the University of Miami. In the lawsuit, Sasson, who claims to be a law student, alleges that he assisted Braun in his original arbitration resulting from a positive drug test in 2011 and that afterwards, Braun refused to pay him. Sasson also alleges that Braun's use of performance enhancing drugs dates back to Braun's days at the University of Miami. "Ryan Braun sued by longtime friend". After filing the suit, Braun's attorneys attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed, but in January 2014, a Milwaukee County judge refused to dismiss the lawsuit. "Suit Against Ryan Braun Intact". 

==Player profile==

===Hitting===

Braun has the ability to hit for average and significant power. His fluid swing is compact and short, with tremendous bat speed and a protracted follow-through. Morosi, Jon Paul, "Fielder, Braun are game's best power-hitting duo," Fox Sports, June 21, 2000. Retrieved June 21, 2009. Braun waits well on offspeed pitches, and uses the entire field. He drives the ball, no matter where it is in the strike zone. "Profile: Ryan Braun", Schellenger, Koby, Project Prospect, December 27, 2006. Retrieved December 27, 2007. Brewers hitting coach Jim Skaalen observed: "He's got tremendously quick hands and really hits through the ball. He stays on the ball as well as anyone we've got." 

===Speed===
In addition, his speed garnered him comparisons to New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez. Braun has been timed at 4.2 seconds to first base from the right side of the plate. In spring training in 2007, he was second-fastest in the Brewers' 60-yard dash. "Brewers' prospect Braun focusing on defense" Beloit Daily News, March 17, 2007. Retrieved September 11, 2007. 

===Defense===

====Third base====
A shortstop most of his life and in college, Braun was inconsistent on defense after switching to third base in 2006. However, he was noted for his athleticism, his occasional web gems, and particularly for his powerful throwing arm, which was rated the best infield arm in the Brewers' minor league system by Baseball America in early 2007. "Top 10 Prospects: Milwaukee Brewers" Haudricourt, Tom, Baseball America, February 2, 2007. Retrieved September 11, 2007. Braun was charged with 34 errors in 2006, the majority on throws. "It's a matter of proper footwork", said Ash in early 2007. "Most of his problems come because he relies on his arm, which is very strong." "Waiting for Word on Third; Corey Koskie's Slow Recovery from Injury has the Breweres Pondering Options" Feuerherd, Vic, Wisconsin State Journal, January 17, 2007 accessed December 27, 2007 

While Yost removed Braun from a number of games in September 2007 for defense, he praised Braun for his improvements. "Braun on the defensive; Yost has consistently lifted slugger in late-inning situations", McCalvy, Adam, mlb.com, September 23, 2007. Retrieved September 24, 2007. "The great thing about it is it doesn't involve throwing at all now", said Yost, referring to Braun's biggest issue in the spring. "It involves first-step quickness to the ball, which will increase his range. needs to soften his hands a little bit. hand-eye coordination to the ball needs to be a little better. That comes with repetition, repetition, repetition." Braun finished 2007 last of all eligible third basemen in fielding percentage (.895, with 26 errors; only the fourth third baseman since 1916 to play 100 games or more in a season and have a fielding percentage under .900), "Ryan Braun: Greatest First-Year Slugger Ever?" Lederer, Rich, Baseball Analysts, August 20, 2007. Retrieved October 18, 2007. range factor (2.11), and zone rating (.697). His target at first base was Prince Fielder, who finished 2007 last of all eligible major league first basemen in range factor (8.49), and first in errors (14). Similarly, his target at second base, Rickie Weeks, had the lowest fielding percentage of all NL second basemen (.976), and the lowest zone rating among all major league second basemen (.737). 

It was suggested that it was possible that Braun would learn to play the position adequately, given that David Wright (who tied for the major league lead in errors by a third baseman in 2005, his second in the league) "MLB Player Fielding Stats: 2005", ESPN. Retrieved November 23, 2007. in 2007 became a "passable defender" (and won the NL Gold Glove at third base). "Braun wouldn't veto third amendment" Hunt, Michael, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 16, 2007. Retrieved November 17, 2007. 

Braun, for his part, noted after the 2007 season: "It's only my second full (professional) year of playing third base. I don't expect to be perfect, but I certainly expect to be better than I have been. I have to continue to work hard, and hopefully I'll improve." 

====Left field====
In January 2008, however, the Brewers acquired three-time Gold Glove-winning center fielder Mike Cameron, prompting the team to move center fielder Bill Hall to third base and Braun to left field.

Before the news broke, Braun was taking ground balls at Pepperdine University near Los Angeles. General Manager Doug Melvin left him a voicemail, and after returning the call and learning of the team's plans Braun grabbed his outfield glove, and started taking fly balls. Braun supported the switch. "outfield glove is not broken in yet, but it will get there. I feel like I'm a good enough athlete and have a good enough work ethic to make the transition pretty easily." 

While Braun's outfield experience until then had consisted of "two games in center field my freshman year in high school," "Hall, Braun positioned to win after offseason changes" Nightengale, Bob, USA Today, March 3, 2008. Retrieved March 4, 2008. Braun had speed, arm strength that would make him stand out against other left fielders, and athleticism to make the transition. "New faces, position changes for Brewers this spring" Crasnick, Jerry, ESPN, February 24, 2008. Retrieved February 25, 2008. Early reports were good, as in spring training in 2008 he showed an ability to cover ground, go back on the ball, to his left into the gap, and to his right to cut off balls down the line. Braun looked good tracking liners and high fly balls, and took good routes when cutting off balls down the line or in the gap, holding batters to singles. "Braun gets turned around" Witrado, Anthony, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, March 29, 2008, accessed March 29, 2008 In March 2008 Manager Ned Yost said that Braun has been "spectacular" in left, "Ask the manager: Ned Yost" Nightengale, Bob, USA Today, March 3, 2008. Retrieved March 3, 2008. and "he's got an opportunity one day to win a Gold Glove in left field. He certainly does." "Braun making strides; Yost likes his quick progress", Haudricort, Tom, March 8, 2008, accessed March 10, 2008 

In July, by which time Braun was being mentioned in the press as a Gold Glove candidate, Ed Sedar, the Brewers' outfield defense expert, said: "He probably has the best arm in baseball in left field. He can cover more ground than 90% of the outfielders out there." "Braun excelling at plate, in field; Former third baseman finding left field suits him just fine" Radcliffe, JR, mlb.com, July 27, 2008. Retrieved March 6, 2009. 

In 2008, Braun led all major league outfielders with a 1.000 fielding percentage. He also led all NL left fielders in putouts (275), and was second in the league in range factor (1.95) and fourth in assists (9), in 1,310.1 innings. "MLB Player Fielding Stats: 2008", ESPN 

On May 23, 2009, Braun was charged with his first error ever in 190 games in left field, when his throw to third was not caught by either Bill Hall or Craig Counsell, one of whom should have caught it according to Manager Ken Macha, but both of whom were confused as to who was covering the base. "Mauer power: Swarzak, Twins beat Brewers 6–2", Campbell, Dave, Washington Post, May 23, 2009. Retrieved June 2, 2009. In July 2009, ESPNs Jon Heyman wrote that Braun had "become a terrific left fielder in no time". Braun led all NL left fielders in 2009 with a .994 fielding percentage. He also led them in putouts (304) and range factor (2.06), was tied for the lead in double plays (2), and was third in assists (8), in 1,364 innings. 

In 2010, Braun led NL left fielders in putouts for the third year in a row (279), was second in range factor per game (1.86), and 4th in assists (6). 

==Jewish heritage==
Braun in 2008
Braun's father Joe, most of whose side of the family was murdered in the Holocaust, was born in Israel. His father immigrated to the United States at age seven. His father is Jewish and his mother Diane is Catholic. 

Braun said "I am Jewish", and "I'm extremely proud to be a role model for young Jewish kids." "It's something I'm really proud of. But I don't want to make it into something more than what it is. I didn't have a Bar Mitzvah.... I didn't celebrate the holidays." He reiterated: "It's something that draws a lot of interest and something I take pride in." Boroson, Warren. "Why Jews love baseball", The Jewish Standard, August 8, 2008. Retrieved September 15, 2008. Braun's mother, however, said he is not Jewish. 

Braun's nickname "The Hebrew Hammer", which was also a nickname for former All-Stars Al Rosen and Hank Greenberg, refers to his Jewish heritage. It is also the nickname of former teammate Gabe Kapler and alludes to former Milwaukee star Hank Aaron (whose nickname was "Hammerin' Hank"), and the movie The Hebrew Hammer, starring Adam Goldberg. In response to the nickname, Braun's mother reiterated, “He’s totally not Jewish. I heard some organization started called him ‘The Hebrew Hammer.’ I said, ‘Oh no.’ My mother would be rolling over in her grave if she heard that.” 

Braun is one of the highest-drafted Jewish ballplayers in the history of professional baseball. The New York Yankees made Ron Blomberg the number one pick in the 1967 draft. Braun was considered the best Jewish minor league baseball prospect in 2006, and became major league baseball's first Jewish Rookie of the Year the following season. In each of 2007 and 2008, Braun hit more home runs (34 and 37) than all but 3 of the top 10 career Jewish home run hitters had hit in their best seasons. Only Hank Greenberg (58), Shawn Green (49), and Al Rosen (43) hit more in a single year. Through the 2012 season, he was 2nd on the all-time career list in batting average (behind Hank Greenberg), tied for 3rd in home runs (with Sid Gordon; behind Hank Greenberg and Shawn Green), 7th on the RBI list (behind Al Rosen), and 8th in hits (behind Mike Lieberthal), for Jewish major leaguers. 

"Braun" was, coincidentally, the family name of Sandy Koufax, until his mother remarried and he took his stepfather's name. "There's no connection that I know of", Braun said, "but it's kind of cool." In another coincidence, Braun lived for a time with his maternal grandfather in a house that previously belonged to Jewish Hall of Fame first baseman Hank Greenberg. Braun's grandfather has lived in the house for over 40 years. 

In December 2007, Braun was the only Jewish athlete invited by President George W. Bush to the annual Hanukkah Dinner at the White House, where he talked baseball with the President. Braun was later featured in the 2008 Hank Greenberg 75th Anniversary edition of Jewish Major Leaguers Baseball Cards, published in affiliation with Fleer Trading Cards and the American Jewish Historical Society, commemorating the Jewish Major Leaguers from 1871 through 2008. He joined, among other Jewish major leaguers, Brad Ausmus, Kevin Youkilis, Ian Kinsler, Brian Horwitz, Gabe Kapler, Jason Marquis, Ike Davis, Jason Hirsh, John Grabow, Craig Breslow, Scott Feldman, and Scott Schoeneweis. Braun was one of three Jewish players in the 2008 All-Star Game, joining Kinsler and Youkilis, and one of three Jewish players on the Team USA 2009 World Baseball Classic team, joining Youkilis and Grabow. "Editorial: Anti-semitism in Venezuela; There is No Joy In Caracas," March 19, 2009, accessed March 19, 2009 He and Feldman were voted the 2009 co-Jewish MVP by Jewish Major Leaguers, and he was voted the 2010 Jewish MVP as Breslow received the Most Valuable Jewish Pitcher honors. "There aren't too many Jewish athletes at the highest level", said Braun. "It's something that I certainly embrace." 

Braun was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in January 2010. 

The Jewish Daily Forward listed him as number five in the 2011 "Forward 50", its list of the 50 most significant American Jews. 

In 2011, Braun became the fourth self-identifying Jewish player, and the first in nearly a half-century, to win the Most Valuable Player Award, after Greenberg (1935 and 1940), Rosen (1953), and Koufax (1963). In April 2012, Shalom Life ranked him Number 5 on its list of “the 50 most talented, intelligent, funny, and gorgeous Jewish men in the world." 

==Outside pursuits==
Braun developed his own signature fashion t-shirt line for Affliction Clothing, a California-based clothing manufacturer who manufactures shirts that are garment dyed and hand distressed. In August 2008, he filmed a YouTube video with supermodel Marisa Miller for Remington's ShortCut clippers.

In October 2008, Apple released a commercial for a new iPhone, that showed a clip of Braun's 10th inning walk-off grand slam against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 25, 2008, which kept the Brewers' Wild Card hopes alive. Gatorade used the same clip in its November 2008 "League of Clutch" commercial.
