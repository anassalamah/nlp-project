The Heart is a Lonely Hunter (1940) is the debut novel by the American author Carson McCullers; she was 23 at the time of publication. It is about a deaf man named John Singer and the people he encounters in a 1930s mill town in the state of Georgia, US. When published it created a literary sensation, enjoying a meteoric rise to the top of the bestseller lists in 1940; it was the first in a string of works by McCullers that give voice to those who are rejected, forgotten, mistreated or oppressed.

==Plot introduction==
The book begins with a focus on the relationship between two close friends, John Singer and Spiros Antonopoulous. The two are described as deaf-mutes who have lived together for several years. Antonopoulous begins to have repeated encounters with the law, and despite attempts at intervention from Singer is eventually put into an insane asylum in Chicago. Now alone, Singer moves into a new room.
