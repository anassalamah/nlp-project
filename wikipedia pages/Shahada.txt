[[Shahada]]

The Shahada ( , from the verb , "to witness" or "to testify") or Kalimat ash-Shahādah (Arabic: ) is an Islamic creed declaring belief in the oneness of God and the acceptance of Muhammad as God's prophet. The declaration, in its shortest form, reads:
: 
: 

: "There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God."

In Shia Islam, the creed is expanded with the addition of a phrase concerning Ali:
: 
: 
: "and Ali is the wali ("friend", "viceregent") of God". 

== Overview ==

The word shahādah () is a noun stemming from the verb shahida () meaning "he observed, witnessed, or testified"; when used in legal terms, shahādah is a testimony to the occurrence of events, such as debt, adultery, or divorce. The New Encyclopedia of Islam, Cyril hi tom Alta Mira Press, 2001, p. 416. The shahādah can also be expressed in the dual form shahādatān (, literally "two testimonials"), which refers to the dual act of observing or seeing and then the declaration of the observation. The person giving the testimony is called a shāhid (شاهِد), with the stress on the first syllable. The two acts in Islam are observing or perceiving that there is no god but God and testifying or witnessing that Muhammad is the messenger of God. In a third meaning, shahādah or more commonly istishhād (), means "martyrdom", the shahīd () pronounced with stress on the last syllable ("martyr") demonstrating the ultimate expression of faith. The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Volume IX, Klijkebrille, 1997, p. 201. Shahīd can also be used in a non-Islamic religious context. Long before the advent of Islam, Christian Arabs of the Middle East used the word shahīd referencing to someone that was wrongly killed or someone that died for his family, his Christian faith or his country. The two words shāhid (, "witness") and shahīd (, "martyr") are pre-Islamic; both are paradigms of the root verb (شَهَدَ, shahada, "he observed").

This declaration, or statement of faith, is called the (, literally "word"). Recitation of the shahādah, the "oath" or "testimony", is the most important article of faith for Muslims. Non-Muslims wishing to convert to Islam do so by a public recitation of this creed. Farah (1994), p. 135 Most Muslims count it as the first of the Five Pillars of Islam, while the Twelver and Ismaili Shi'a connect it to their respective lists of pillars of the faith. 
The complete shahādah cannot be found in the Quran, but comes from hadiths. 

== Recitation ==

According to most traditional schools (madh'hab), three honest recitations of the shahadah in Arabic is all that is required for a person to convert to Islam. In usage, the two occurrences of or similar ( "I testify that" or "I bear witness that") are very often omitted. The recitation of the shahadah needs to be made in the presence of an Imaam and other people as witnesses. http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/shahadah.shtml 

== History ==

Silver coin of the Mughal Emperor Akbar with inscriptions of the Islamic declaration of faith, the declaration reads: "There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the messenger of God."

Another of the earliest surviving translations of the shahadah into a foreign language is in Greek, from the reign of al-Walid I (86–96 AH, 705–715 CE): (Ούκ Έστιν θεός εἰ μὴ ὁ θεὸς μόνος, Μααμετ ἀπόστολος θεοῦ) (Ouk estin theos ei mē ho theos monos; Maamet apostolos theou). "There is no god except for the God alone; Muhammad is the Apostle of God." "Allah", the Arabic word for "the God", is translated as and "Muhammad" is transliterated as .

A variation of the shahādah can be found at Bab al-Futuh built by the Fatimid minister Al-Afdal Shahanshah (952-975 A.D.), northern wall of Fatimid Cairo. It reads: bismi -llāhi -r-rahmāni -r-rahīm lā ʾilāha ʾilā -llāh waḥdahu lā sharīk lahu muḥammad rasūlu -llāh ʿalī walī allāh ( "In the name of God the Merciful the Compassionate, there is no god but God the One, no partner has he, Muhammad is the Messenger of God, Ali is the walī of God").

== Conditions ==

Muslims believe that the shahadah is without value unless it is earnest. Islamic scholars have therefore developed, based on the data of the Quran and hadith, essential criteria for an expression of the shahadah to be in earnest. These criteria are generally divided into seven to nine groups; the varying numbers and orderings are not due to disagreements about what the criteria actually are, but rather different ways of dividing them. 

One such list of seven critical conditions of the shahadah, without which it is considered to be meaningless, are as follows:.
* Al-ʿIlm (): Knowledge of the meaning of the Shahadah, its negation and affirmation.
* Al-Yaqīn (): Certainty; perfect knowledge of it that counteracts suspicion and doubt.
* Al-Ikhlāṣ (): Sincerity, to negate shirk.
* Aṣ-Ṣidq (): Truthfulness, that permits neither falsehood nor hypocrisy.
* Al-Maḥabbah (): Love of the Shahadah and its meaning, and being happy with it.
* Al-Inqiyād (): Submission to its rightful requirements, which are the duties that must be performed with sincerity to God (alone).
* Al-Qubūl (): Acceptance that contradicts rejection.

The second part of the Shahada carries several conditions as well:
* To believe in Muhammad and in whatever he said and conveyed in his message as the seal of the prophets.
* To obey him in whatever he commanded.
* To stay away from or avoid whatever he commanded Muslims not to do.
* To follow or emulate him in ( "worship"), ( "manners") and way of life.
* To understand, practice and promote his sunnah ("habits") as well as possible, without creating chaos, enmity or harm.

== Flags ==

===National flags===

Of sovereign states recognized internationally, the flags of Saudi Arabia and of Afghanistan include the shahada in their designs. The 2004 draft constitution of Afghanistan proposed a flag featuring the shahada in white script centered on a red background. The design from the Saudi flag has been used in the flag of the unrecognized state of Somaliland since 1996.

===Shahada calligraphy in the flags of Saudi Arabia and Hamas===

It can be seen in the second flag that the name of God () is written in a higher position. The name for God is written twice in each flag, but the first () is written after the second () only once in the first instance of Allah in the flag of Hamas (pink), and only once in the second appearance in the flag of Saudi Arabia (green). This overwriting is also visible for the lam of rasul(u) (light blue), but only in the Saudi Arabian flag. The ligature () is always written the same way in the Saudi Arabian flag, but the calligraphy is changed in the case of the second (red) of the Hamas flag at the left.

===Islamic flag===

Flags reported as in use in Islam have been frequently included the shahada, usually on a black background, since the time of Muhammad. Between 1997 and 2001, the Taliban used a white flag with the shahada inscribed in black as the flag of their Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.

Flags that include the shahada, often written on a green background, have also been displayed by supporters of Hamas in rallies during the 2000s.
