[[Spartacus]]

Spartacus ( ; ) (c. 109–71 BC) was a Thracian gladiator, who, along with the Gauls Crixus, Oenomaus, Castus and Gannicus, was one of the slave leaders in the Third Servile War, a major slave uprising against the Roman Republic. Little is known about Spartacus beyond the events of the war, and surviving historical accounts are sometimes contradictory and may not always be reliable. All sources agree that he was a former gladiator and an accomplished military leader.

This rebellion, interpreted by some as an example of oppressed people fighting for their freedom against a slave-owning oligarchy, has been an inspiration to many political thinkers, and has been featured in literature, television, and film. Although not contradicted by classical historians, no historical account mentions that the goal of the rebels was to end slavery in the Roman Republic, nor do any of the actions of rebel leaders, who themselves committed numerous atrocities, seem specifically aimed at ending slavery. 

==Origins==
Balkan tribes, including the Maedi.
The ancient sources agree that Spartacus was a Thracian. Plutarch describes him as "a Thracian of Nomadic stock". Plutarch, Crassus 8 Appian says he was "a Thracian by birth, who had once served as a soldier with the Romans, but had since been a prisoner and sold for a Gladiator". Appian, Civil Wars 1.116 

Florus (2.8.8) described him as one "who from Thracian mercenary, had become a Roman soldier, of a soldier a deserter and robber, and afterward, from consideration of his strength, a gladiator". Florus, Epitome of Roman History 2.8 The authors refer to the Thracian tribe of the Maedi, which occupied the area on the southwestern fringes of Thrace, along its border with the Roman Macedonia - present day south-western Bulgaria. Plutarch also writes that Spartacus' wife, a prophetess of the Maedi tribe, was enslaved with him.

The name Spartacus is otherwise attested in the Black Sea region: kings of the Thracian dynasty of the Cimmerian Bosporus Diodorus Siculus, Historical Library Book 12 and Pontus Diodorus Siculus, Historical Library Book 16 are known to have borne it, and a Thracian "Sparta" "Spardacus" Theucidides, History of the Peloponnesian War 2.101 or "Sparadokos", Tribes, Dynasts and Kingdoms of Northern Greece: History and Numismatics father of Seuthes I of the Odrysae, is also known.

==Enslavement and escape==
The extent of the Roman Republic at 100 BC.
According to the differing sources and their interpretation, Spartacus either was an auxiliary from the Roman legions later condemned to slavery, or a captive taken by the legions. Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Plutarch, Crassus, 8:2. Note: Spartacus' status as an auxilia is taken from the Loeb edition of Appian translated by Horace White, which states “...who had once served as a soldier with the Romans...”. However, the translation by John Carter in the Penguin Classics version reads: “...who had once fought against the Romans and after being taken prisoner and sold...”. Spartacus was trained at the gladiatorial school (ludus) near Capua belonging to Lentulus Batiatus.
In 73 BC, Spartacus was among a group of gladiators plotting an escape. Plutarch, Crassus, 8:1–2; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Livy, Periochae, 95:2; Florus, Epitome, 2.8. Plutarch claims 78 escaped, Livy claims 74, Appian “about seventy”, and Florus says “thirty or rather more men”. “Choppers and spits” is from Life of Crassus. 

The plot was betrayed but about 70 However, according to Cicero (Ad Atticum VI, ii, 8) at the beginning his followers were much less than 50. men seized kitchen implements, fought their way free from the school, and seized several wagons of gladiatorial weapons and armor. The escaped slaves defeated a small force sent after them, plundered the region surrounding Capua, recruited many other slaves into their ranks, and eventually retired to a more defensible position on Mount Vesuvius. Plutarch, Crassus, 9:1. Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Florus, Epitome, 2.8. 

Once free, the escaped gladiators chose Spartacus and two Gallic slaves—Crixus and Oenomaus—as their leaders. Although Roman authors assumed that the slaves were a homogeneous group with Spartacus as their leader, they may have projected their own hierarchical view of military leadership onto the spontaneous organization of the slaves, reducing other slave leaders to subordinate positions in their accounts. The positions of Crixus and Oenomaus—and later, Gannicus and Castus—cannot be clearly determined from the sources.

==Third Servile War==

Slaves in chains, relief found at Smyrna, Roman province of Asia (modern Turkey)
The response of the Romans was hampered by the absence of the Roman legions, which were already engaged in fighting a revolt in Hispania and the Third Mithridatic War. Furthermore, the Romans considered the rebellion more of a policing matter than a war. Rome dispatched militia under the command of praetor Gaius Claudius Glaber, which besieged Spartacus and his camp on Mount Vesuvius, hoping that starvation would force Spartacus to surrender. They were surprised when Spartacus, who had made ropes from vines, climbed down the cliff side of the volcano with his men and attacked the unfortified Roman camp in the rear, killing most of them. Plutarchwe46', Crassus, 9:1–3; Frontinus, Stratagems, Book I, 5:20–22; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Broughton, Magistrates of the Roman Republic, p. 109. 

The slaves also defeated a second expedition, nearly capturing the praetor commander, killing his lieutenants and seizing the military equipment. Plutarch, Crassus, 9:4–5; Livy, Periochae , 95; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116; Sallust, Histories, 3:64–67. With these successes, more and more slaves flocked to the Spartacan forces, as did "many of the herdsmen and shepherds of the region", swelling their ranks to some 70,000. Plutarch, Crassus, 9:3; Appian, Civil War, 1:116. 

In these altercations Spartacus proved to be an excellent tactician, suggesting that he may have had previous military experience. Though the slaves lacked military training, they displayed a skillful use of available local materials and unusual tactics when facing the disciplined Roman armies. Frontinus, Stratagems, Book I, 5:20–22 and Book VII:6. They spent the winter of 73–72 BC training, arming and equipping their new recruits, and expanding their raiding territory to include the towns of Nola, Nuceria, Thurii and Metapontum. Florus, Epitome, 2.8. The distance between these locations and the subsequent events indicate that the slaves operated in two groups commanded by the remaining leaders Spartacus and Crixus.

In the spring of 72 BC, the slaves left their winter encampments and began to move northward. At the same time, the Roman Senate, alarmed by the defeat of the praetorian forces, dispatched a pair of consular legions under the command of Lucius Gellius Publicola and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus. Appian, Civil Wars, 1:116–117; Plutarch, Crassus 9:6; Sallust, Histories, 3:64–67. The two legions were initially successful—defeating a group of 30,000 slaves commanded by Crixus near Mount Garganus Appian, Civil Wars, 1:117; Plutarch, Crassus 9:7; Livy, Periochae 96. —but then were defeated by Spartacus. These defeats are
depicted in divergent ways by the two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by Appian and Plutarch. Appian, Civil Wars, 1:117. Plutarch, Crassus, 9:7. 

Alarmed by the apparently unstoppable rebellion, the Senate charged Marcus Licinius Crassus, the wealthiest man in Rome and the only volunteer for the position, with ending the rebellion.
Crassus was put in charge of eight legions, approximately 40,000 trained Roman soldiers, Plutarch, Crassus 10:1. Appian, Civil Wars, 1:118; Smith, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, "Exercitus", p.494. which he treated with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving the punishment of unit decimation. Appian, Civil Wars, 1:118. When Spartacus and his followers, who for unclear reasons had retreated to the south of Italy, moved northward again in early 71 BC, Crassus deployed six of his legions on the borders of the region and detached his legate Mummius with two legions to maneuver behind Spartacus. Though ordered not to engage the slaves, Mummius attacked at a seemingly opportune moment but was routed. Plutarch, Crassus, 10:1–3. After this, Crassus' legions were victorious in several engagements, forcing Spartacus farther south through Lucania as Crassus gained the upper hand. By the end of 71 BC, Spartacus was encamped in Rhegium (Reggio Calabria), near the Strait of Messina.

The Fall of Spartacus
According to Plutarch, Spartacus made a bargain with Cilician pirates to transport him and some 2,000 of his men to Sicily, where he intended to incite a slave revolt and gather reinforcements. However, he was betrayed by the pirates, who took payment and then abandoned the rebel slaves. Minor sources mention that there were some attempts at raft and shipbuilding by the rebels as a means to escape, but that Crassus took unspecified measures to ensure the rebels could not cross to Sicily, and their efforts were abandoned. Florus, Epitome, 2.8; Cicero, Orations, "For Quintius, Sextus Roscius...", 5.2 Spartacus' forces then retreated toward Rhegium. Crassus' legions followed and upon arrival built fortifications across the isthmus at Rhegium, despite harassing raids from the rebel slaves. The rebels were now under siege and cut off from their supplies. Plutarch, Crassus, 10:4–5. 

At this time, the legions of Pompey returned from Hispania and were ordered by the Senate to head south to aid Crassus. Contrast Plutarch, Crassus, 11:2 with Appian, Civil Wars, 1:119. While Crassus feared that Pompey's arrival would cost him the credit, Spartacus unsuccessfully tried to reach an agreement with Crassus. Appian, Civil Wars, 1:120. When Crassus refused, a portion of Spartacus' forces fled toward the mountains west of Petelia (modern Strongoli) in Bruttium, with Crassus' legions in pursuit. Appian, Civil Wars, 1:120; Plutarch, Crassus, 10:6. 

When the legions managed to catch a portion of the rebels separated from the main army, Plutarch, Crassus, 11:3; Livy, Periochae, 97:1. Bradley, Slavery and Rebellion. p. 97; Plutarch, Crassus, 11:4. discipline among Spartacus' forces broke down as small groups were independently attacking the oncoming legions. Plutarch, Crassus, 11:5;. Spartacus now turned his forces around and brought his entire strength to bear on the legions in a last stand, in which the slaves were routed completely, with the vast majority of them being killed on the battlefield. Appian, Civil Wars, 1:120; Plutarch, Crassus, 11:6–7; Livy, Periochae, 97.1. 

The final battle that saw the assumed defeat of Spartacus in 71 BC took place on the present territory of Senerchia on the right bank of the river Sele in the area that includes the border with Oliveto Citra up to those of Calabritto, near the village of Quaglietta, in High Sele Valley, which at that time was part of Lucania. In this area, since 1899, there have been finds of armor and swords of the Roman era.

Plutarch, Appian and Florus all claim that Spartacus died during the battle, however Appian also reports that his body was never found. Appian, Civil Wars, 1:120; Florus, Epitome, 2.8. Six thousand survivors of the revolt captured by the legions of Crassus were crucified, lining the Appian Way from Rome to Capua. Appian, Civil Wars, 1.120. 

==Objectives==
Crassus crucified 6,000 of Spartacus's followers on the road between Rome and Capua.
Classical historians were divided as to what the motives of Spartacus were. None of Spartacus' actions overtly suggest that he aimed at reforming Roman society or abolishing slavery.

Plutarch writes that Spartacus wished to escape north into Cisalpine Gaul and disperse his men back to their homes. If escaping the Italian peninsula was indeed his goal, it is not clear why Spartacus turned south after defeating the legions commanded by the consuls Lucius Publicola and Gnaeus Clodianus, which left his force a clear passage over the Alps.

Appian and Florus write that he intended to march on Rome itself. Appian, Civil Wars, 1:117; Florus, Epitome, 2.8. Appian also states that he later abandoned that goal, which might have been no more than a reflection of Roman fears.

Based on the events in late 73 BC and early 72 BC, which suggest independently operating groups of slaves Plutarch, Crassus, 9:7; Appian, Civil Wars, 1:117. and a statement by Plutarch that some of the escaped slaves preferred to plunder Italy, rather than escape over the Alps. Plutarch Crassus, 9:5–6.
