[[Mjolnir (comics)]]

Mjolnir ( ) is a fictional weapon that appears in publications from Marvel Comics. It is the favored weapon of the superhero Thor. The weapon, which first appears in Journey into Mystery #83, published in August 1962, was created by writer Stan Lee and designed by artists Jack Kirby and Joe Sinnott.

Mjolnir is typically depicted as a large, square-headed gray Lump hammer. It has a short, round handle wrapped in brown leather, culminating in a looped lanyard. The object is based on Mjölnir, the weapon of the mythical Norse god. The hammer's name translates as "The Crusher" or "The Grinder."

==Publication history==
Mjolnir debuted in Journey into Mystery #83 (Aug. 1962), and was immediately established as the main weapon of the Thunder god Thor. The weapon's origin is revealed in Thor Annual #11 (1983), although another version is presented in Thor vol. 2, #80 (Aug. 2004).

Other significant moments in Marvel continuity include the altering of Mjolnir's enchantments in Thor #282 (April 1979) and Thor #340 (Feb. 1984); the temporary possession of Mjolnir by a member of the Enchanters Three in Thor vol. 3, #14–15 (Aug.–Sep. 1999); and when the hammer has been damaged, occurring in Journey Into Mystery #119 (Aug. 1965); Avengers #215 (Jan. 1982); Thor #388 (Feb. 1988);Thor vol. 2, #11 (May 1999); Thor vol. 2, #80 (Aug. 2004) and Thor vol. 3, #600 (Feb. 2009).

==Background==

In Marvel continuity, Mjolnir is forged by Dwarven blacksmiths, and is composed of the fictional Asgardian metal "uru". The side of the hammer carries the inscription "Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor." Journey Into Mystery #83 (Aug. 1962) 

The hammer is created when Thor's adopted brother Loki cuts off the hair of the goddess Sif as part of a cruel jest, and, when threatened with violence by Thor, promises to fetch replacement hair from the dwarf smiths. Loki commissions the hair from the Sons of Ivaldi and the obliging dwarves also make a magic ship and spear as gifts for the gods. Loki is convinced that no one can match their workmanship, and challenges a dwarf named Eitri to make finer treasures. Eitri creates a golden ring and golden boar spear with magical properties, and finally begins work on a hammer. Loki panics at the sight of the treasures, and, afraid he will lose the wager, transforms himself into a mayfly and stings Eitri's assistant on the brow as he is working the bellows for the forge. The assistant stops for a moment to wipe away the blood, and the bellows fall flat. As a result, the hammer's handle is shorter in length than Eitri had originally intended, meaning that the hammer could only be wielded one-handed.

Despite the error, the Norse gods consider Eitri to have forged the greater treasures, and in retaliation Loki loses the bet and the Sons of Ivaldi sew Loki's lips shut. The ruler of the Norse gods, Odin, uses the hammer—called Mjolnir ("Grinder") by Eitri—and eventually passes it to his son Thor, who must first prove he is worthy to wield the weapon. Thor Annual #11 (1983) 

Another version of the hammer's origin is presented in the second volume of the title Thor, stating that Odin orders the dwarven blacksmiths Eitri, Brok and Buri to forge Mjolnir using the core of a star (the movie uses this origin as well, with Odin saying Mjolnir was "forged in the heart of a dying star") and an enchanted forge. The forging of the hammer is apparently so intense it destroys the star and nearly the Earth itself. Thor vol. 2, #80 (Aug. 2004) 

Mjolnir itself has several enchantments: no living being may lift the hammer unless they are worthy; it returns to the exact spot from which it is thrown and returns to Thor when summoned; it may summon the elements of storm (lightning, wind, and rain) by stamping its handle twice on the ground; manipulate the weather on an almost global scale; Amazing Spider-Man #339 (Sept. 1990) 
open interdimensional portals, allowing its wielder to travel to other dimensions (such as from Earth to Asgard); Journey Into Mystery #88 (Jan. 1963) and transform Thor into the guise of a mortal, the physician Donald Blake, by stamping the hammer's head on the ground once. When Thor transforms into Blake, his hammer takes the appearance of a wooden walking stick. When disguised, the hammer's enchantments limiting those who may lift it are not in effect. The hammer itself has also shown to be unaffected by external enchantments. Journey into Mystery #103 (April 1964) 

A previous provision of this enchantment required that the hammer could not be "gone from Thor's grasp," or out of physical contact with Thor for more than "sixty seconds full" without his spontaneous reversion to his mortal self; fortunately, Mjolnir is small enough for the god to tuck it into his belt for times when he prefers to have both his hands free. In some stories this limitation did not apply in Asgard, although this stipulation was removed in a storyline in which this enchantment is transferred to Stormbreaker, the hammer of Beta Ray Bill. Thor #340 (Feb. 1984) After this, the Donald Blake persona disappeared for a time, and Thor assumed a civilian identity simply by changing into modern clothing, carrying Mjolnir concealed within a duffel bag. Thor eventually adopts the mortal persona of Jake Olson as penance for accidentally causing the original Olson's death during a fight, and simply pounds a fist to effect a change; Thor vol. 3, #1 (July 1998) during this time, Mjolnir would disappear when Thor became Olson, and reappear in Thor's fist when returning to his true form.

Mjolnir was originally capable of creating chronal displacement and therefore allowing time travel, Journey Into Mystery #86 (Nov. 1962) although this enchantment was removed by the entity Immortus with the Thunder god's consent to help the planet Phantus which was trapped in Limbo. Thor #282 (April 1979) However, Thor is still able to manipulate time with Mjolnir. Avengers #300 (Feb. 1989) 

When Ragnarok took place, Mjolnir was separated from Thor and fell through the dimensions, creating a tear in Hell that allowed Doctor Doom to escape (Doom having been imprisoned there after his last encounter with the Fantastic Four). Although Doom and the FF attempt to claim the hammer, none of them are able to lift it, resulting in Donald Blake—who had been returned to life when the spell negating his existence wore off with Asgard's destruction—claiming it himself. With Blake and Thor once again co-existing, the hammer resumes its original 'disguise' of a walking-stick (although Blake's original limp healed, he sustained minor spine damage during a later confrontation). The hammer is later damaged in a fight with Bor, Thor's grandfather. Doctor Strange is able to repair the hammer using the Odinforce possessed by Thor, but warns Thor that, should the hammer be damaged in such a manner again, the new link between them could result in Thor being killed himself. The hammer was also sliced in two by the Destroyer, in Thor #118 -he had to go to the forges in Pittsburg to mend it. Thor has several times used the mallet to pin down opponents, since they cannot lift the mallet.

After Thor's death in the fight against the Serpent, Fear Itself #7 Loki is able to take Blake's walking stick—the only remaining trace of Thor after he was 'replaced' by Tanarus—and turn it back into Mjolnir in front of the Silver Surfer, The Mighty Thor #9 the Surfer's energy and Loki's belief in his brother allowing the hammer to return to Thor and restore his memory in time to face the God-Devourer that was about to consume his soul in the afterlife. The Mighty Thor #10 

==Other wielders==
Mjolnir has been wielded by a select number of other individuals: alien Beta Ray Bill; Thor #337 (Nov. 1983) Avenger Captain America; Thor #390 (Apr. 1988) Eric Masterson; Thor #433 (June 1991) Odin (Thor's father); Bor (Thor's grandfather); Thor #600 (April 2009) Buri (also known as Tiwaz, Thor's great-grandfather) Thor #355 (May 1985) and Hulk. Hulk: Let the Battle Begin (2010) and Indestructible Hulk #6 (June 2013) 

The hammer has also been lifted by various sentient constructs (non-sentient machines apparently cannot), Thor #387 (Jan. 1988); Fantastic Four #536 – 537 (May – June 2006) such as Zarrko the Tomorrow Man's mining robot; Journey Into Mystery #101 – 102 (Feb. – March 1964) the Air-Walker (animated by the soul of Nova Corps captain Gabriel Lan); Thor #305 (March 1981) and the Awesome Android (by mimicking Thor's abilities and worthy nature). She-Hulk #14 (Feb. 2007) The hammer has also been lifted by Earth itself when animated via magical means. Marvel Team-Up 26 (Oct. 1974); Avengers #212 (Oct. 1981) 

Several other characters from outside the primary continuity have lifted the hammer, including: Conan the Barbarian; What If? #39 (June 1983) Dargo Ktor (Future Thor); Thor #384 (Oct. 1984) Loki; What If? #47 (Oct. 1984) Magni; Thor vol. 2, #75 (May 2004) Rogue (after absorbing the entirety of Thor's life force and thus essentially becoming Thor); What If? vol. 2 #66 (Oct. 1994) Miguel O'Hara (Spider-Man 2099); 2099: Manifest Destiny (March 1998) Woden; Guardians of the Galaxy #43 (Dec. 1993) Alex Power; Thor and the Warriors Four #4 (July 2010) and the DC Comics characters Superman (who is amazed by the hammer, stating while holding it and Captain America's shield "Oh my lord, the power! Never felt so— Never would have guessed—") Avengers/JLA #4 (May 2004) and Wonder Woman. Marvel vs DC #4 (April 1996) 

Several imitations of Mjolnir have also existed. These include Stormbreaker and the mace Thunderstrike, created for Beta Ray Bill Thor #339 (Jan. 1984)) and Eric Masterson respectively. Thor #459 (Feb. 1993) Loki has been responsible for the creation of several imitations – a version of Mjolnir is presented to the mutant X-Men member Storm in an attempt to control her, X-Men Annual #9 (1985) while another version is given to the mercenary Deadpool to spite Thor. Deadpool #37 (Feb. 2000) Loki also allows Surtur to use the forge Mjolnir was created from to craft copies during Ragnarok. HYDRA created evil versions of Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye and Thor, the Thor imitator had a technological imitation of Mjolnir. The Amazing Spider-Man #520 (August 2005) 
Tony Stark and Reed Richards also create a technological imitation Mjolnir for use by Ragnarok, the clone of Thor, during the Civil War storyline. Civil War #1–7 (May 2006 – Jan. 2007) A tiny version was created from a sliver of Mjolnir for the use of Throg, leader of the Pet Avengers.

==Powers and abilities==
Mjolnir can be used both offensively and defensively.

Described as impacting with sufficient force to "destroy mountains," Thor #312 (Oct. 1981) with only primary adamantium proving too impervious. Avengers #68 (Sep. 1969) Other offensive capabilities include creating vortices and forcefields (capable of containing an explosion that could potentially destroy a galaxy); Thor #407 (Sept. 1989) emitting mystical blasts of energy; controlling electromagnetism; molecular manipulation; Journey Into Mystery #115 (April 1965) and generating the Geo-Blast (an energy wave that taps a planet's gravitational force), Thor #161 (Feb. 1969) Anti-Force (energy created to counter-act another force), Thor vol. 3, #25 (July 2000) the thermo-blast which can even challenge such beings as Ego the living planet, Thor vol. 1, #133 and god Blast (a blast that taps into Thor's life force). Thor vol. 3, #12 (June 1999) The hammer can travel through planets to return to Thor. Thor Vol 2 #4 It can even create antimatter particles Journey into Mystery #85 and whirling it round can create wind powerful enough to lift the Taj Mahal. Journey into Mystery #94 

There are also other several rarely used abilities. Mjolnir can track a person Avengers #13 (Feb. 1965) and mystical items; Journey Into Mystery #120 (Sept. 1965) absorb energy, such as draining the Asgardian powers of the Wrecking Crew into the Wrecker; Avengers #277 (March 1987) or detect illusions, as Thor once commanded the hammer to strike the demonic Mephisto, who was hiding amongst false images of himself. Thor #310 (Aug. 1981) As a former religious relic, Mjolnir is lethal to the undead, causing creatures such as vampires to burst into flame and crumble to dust. Thor #332 (June 1983) Mjolnir also can project images, as Thor shows a glimpse of Asgard to fellow Avenger Iron Man. Earth's Mightiest Heroes #1–8 (Jan.–May 2005) It is near-indestructible, surviving bullets, Journey into Mystery #100 Anti-matter, Avengers #8 and the Melter's melting beam. Avengers #15 

The hammer has two properties relating to movement. When it is deliberately thrown by Thor, it will return to his hand despite any intervening obstacles or distance, even traveling through planets to return to Thor. When it is dropped or set aside, it takes a fixed position, from which it cannot be moved except by a 'worthy' individual. Thor vol. 1, #337 

The hammer has also drained energy from the radioactive supervillain called the Presence, who is forced to surrender before being killed. Avengers vol. 3, #44 (Aug. 2001) Mjolnir was able to absorb, contain, and direct the energy of a Null Bomb, which was powerful enough to destroy an entire galaxy. Thor #407 Mjolnir also causes a side effect when used against the hero Union Jack: when Thor erroneously attacks the hero with a blast of lightning and then cancels the offensive, Union Jack is accidentally endowed with the ability to generate electricity. Invaders #33 (Oct. 1978) The hammer has been used to both power an Atlantean warship JLA/Avengers #4 (Jan. 2004) and temporarily drain the forcefield of the villain Juggernaut. Thor #411–412 (both Dec. 1989) If someone swears on the hammer their spirit can be summoned up after death. (Thor vol 3 #11) As well as absorbing radiation, the hammer can repel it back. Avengers vol. 1 #8 

But Mjolnir is also not indestructible, having been damaged several times: a force beam from the Asgardian Destroyer slices it in two; Journey Into Mystery #119 (Aug. 1965); repaired Journey Into Mystery #120 (Sept. 1965) the Molecule Man dispels the atomic bonds between the hammer's molecules, vaporizing Mjolnir; Avengers#215 (Jan. 1982) and restored in Avengers#216 (Feb. 1982) the hammer shatters after channeling an unmeasurable amount of energy at the Celestial Exitar; Thor #388 (Feb. 1988) and restored by the Celestials in Thor #389 (Mar. 1988) Dark god Perrikus slices Mjolnir in half with a magical scythe; Thor vol. 2, #11 (May 1999) and restored Thor vol. 2, #11 (June 1999) and the hammer is shattered when it collides with the uru weapons of Loki's Storm Giant followers, resulting in an atomic-scale explosion. Thor vol. 2, #80 (Aug. 2004). Not seen again until Thor vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2007) 

==Other versions==
During the Celestial Saga storyline, an earlier version of Mjolnir is revealed to exist and was apparently thrown to Midgard (Earth) by Thor's sons, Modi and Magni, landing in the Rhine river where it transformed into the magical Rhinegold. Thor #294 (Apr. 1980) 

A version of Mjolnir in the What If? series was wielded by Rogue after she accidentally absorbed Thor's powers, the remnants of Thor in her psyche helping her assume his role.

In a future visited by the Hulk where Earth had been decimated by nuclear wars, Thor's hammer was one of the many mementos of the age of heroes kept by the now-elderly Rick Jones; the Maestro—the Hulk's twisted future self—attempted to use the hammer against the Hulk during their second confrontation in Rick's museum of hero memorabilia, but failed to lift it even with Thor's death as he was naturally unworthy to do so. Hulk: Future Imperfect #2 (Jan 1993) A later storyline set before the Hulk's fight with the Maestro featured the elder Rick working with his younger self to defeat Thanatos- another alternate Rick- by using his own ability to summon and lift the hammer, explaining that he had been judged worthy to use it for things that young Rick had yet to do and Thanatos would never achieve. Captain Marvel (Vol. 3) #27–30 (March–May 2002) In a similar but alternate dystopian future, Mjolnir also rests in a super-hero artifact vault overseen by Rick Jones. "The Last Avengers Story" #1-2 (Nov. 1995) 

Mjolnir can be seen as one of the many treasures in the one-shot 'The Last Heist' that takes place in the "Tellos" universe.

In the Ultimate Marvel imprint title The Ultimates and its sequel The Ultimates 2, the Ultimate version of Thor wields a Mjolnir styled after a classical war hammer. The Ultimates #4-13 (March 2002) It is not magical in origin, but rather an advanced technological marvel designed by the European Union Super Soldier Program to mimic Thor's powers. At the end of The Ultimates 2 Thor proves his divinity and reclaims his Asgardian powers to defeat Loki. The Ultimates 2 #1-13(February 2005-February 2007) In The Ultimates 3: Who Killed The Scarlet Witch, Thor wields a hammer more closely resembling the mainstream Marvel Universe Mjolnir. The Ultimates 3" #1 In one scene where he is entering a secured building, the computer controlling access identifies first Thor, then Mjolnir; this leads another character to question why the computer identified Mjolnir as a separate, sentient organism, but Thor does not give an explanation for this. He later displays a wall of weapons, including both hammers, which he states were gifts from his father forged by Ulik the Troll. The Ultimates 3" #4 However in the prequel miniseries it is revealed that the original hammer is not the "real" Mjolnir but instead Dr. Braddock gives Thor tech-armor, and Thor suggests to turn the power supply into a hammer. Ultimate Comics: Thor#4 It is believed that both versions of the hammer is not restricted by the worthiness test. In Thor puts his hammer inside the Room With No Doors with his son Modi, so that he may escape the destruction and genocide of the Asgardians. With Thor being the last Asgardian alive and his hammer is gone, he loses his divine powers and becomes mortal. Tony Stark kept Thor's tech armor and hammer since Thor no longer felt he had use for it, and gives it to Thor to "restore" his powers because he feels the world "needs a god of thunder". Ultimate Comics: The Ultimates #3 

==In other media==

Mjolnir debuts in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a post-credits scene in Iron Man 2 by itself at the bottom of a giant crater in New Mexico with S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson informing Nick Fury that "we've found it."
