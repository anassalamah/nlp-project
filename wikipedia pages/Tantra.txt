[[Tantra]]

Sri Yantra in non-traditional colors

Tantra is the name given by scholars to a style of meditation and ritual which arose in India no later than the 5th century AD. The earliest documented use of the word "Tantra" is in the Rigveda (X.71.9). Banerjee, S.C., 1988. Tantra has influenced the Hindu, Bön, Buddhist, and Jain traditions and silk road transmission of Buddhism that spread Buddhism to East and Southeast Asia.

==Definitions==

Several definitions of Tantra exist.

===Traditional===
The Tantric tradition offers various definitions of tantra. One comes from the :

A second, very similar to the first, comes from Swami Satyananda. 

A third comes from the 10th-century Tantric scholar Rāmakaṇṭha, who belonged to the dualist school Śaiva Siddhānta:

Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar describes a tantric individual and a tantric cult:

===Scholastic===
Modern scholars have defined Tantra; David Gordon White of the University of California offers the following:

Anthony Tribe, a scholar of Buddhist Tantra, offers a list of features: 
# Centrality of ritual, especially the worship of deities
# Centrality of mantras
# Visualisation of and identification with a deity
# Need for initiation, esotericism and secrecy
# Importance of a teacher (guru, ācārya)
# Ritual use of maṇḍalas
# Transgressive or antinomian acts
# Revaluation of the body
# Revaluation of the status and role of women
# Analogical thinking (including microcosmic or macrocosmic correlation)
# Revaluation of negative mental states

===Western===
Robert Brown pg. 1 of the intro of the book The Roots of Tantra by Harper, Katherine Anne and Brown, Robert L., 1944 October 6 2002, SUNY series in tantric studies., ISBN 9780791453063 notes that the term "tantrism" is a construct of Western scholarship, not a concept from the religious system itself. s (practitioners of Tantra) did not attempt to define Tantra as a whole; instead, the Tantric dimension of each South Asian religion had its own name:
* Tantric Shaivism was known to its practitioners as the .
* Shaktism is practically synonymous and parallel with Tantra, known to its native practitioners as "Kula marga" or "Kaula".
* Tantric Buddhism has the indigenous name of the Vajrayana.
* Tantric Vaishnavism was known as the Pancharatra.
"Tantra" denotes teachings and practices found in the scriptures known as or ; Āgamic is a synonymous adjective.

==History==

===Golden Age of Hinduism===
Tantrism originated in the early centuries of the common era, developing into a fully articulated tradition by the end of the Gupta period. This was the "Golden Age of Hinduism" (ca. 320–650 AD), which flourished from the Gupta Empire (320 to 550 AD) to the fall of the Harsha Empire (606 to 647 AD). During this period power was centralised, trade increased, legal procedures standardised and literacy grew. Mahayana Buddhism flourished, but the orthodox Brahmana culture began its rejuvenation with the patronage of the Gupta Dynasty. The position of the Brahmans was reinforced, and the first Hindu temples emerged during the late Gupta period.

===Late classical period===

After the end of the Gupta Empire and the collapse of the Harsha Empire, power was decentralised in India. Several larger kingdoms emerged, with "countless vassal states". The kingdoms were ruled by a feudal system, with smaller kingdoms dependent on protection from larger ones. "The great king was remote, was exalted and deified." This was reflected in the Tantric mandala, which could depict the king at its centre.

The disintegration of central power led to religious regionalism and rivalry. Local cults and languages developed, and the influence of "Brahmanic ritualistic Hinduism" diminished. Rural devotional movements arose with Shaivism, Vaisnavism, Bhakti and Tantra, although "sectarian groupings were only at the beginning of their development." Religious movements competed for recognition from local lords. Buddhism lost its stature, and began to disappear from India.

During this period Vedanta changed, incorporating the Buddhist emphases on consciousness and the working of the mind. Buddhism, supported by the ancient Indian urban civilisation, lost influence to the traditional religions rooted in the countryside; in Bengal, Buddhists were persecuted. However, it was also incorporated into Hinduism when Gaudapada reinterpreted the Upanishads in the light of Buddhist philosophy. This also marked a shift from Atman and Brahman as a "living substance" to "maya-vada". where Atman and Brahman are seen as "pure knowledge-consciousness". According to Scheepers, it is this "maya-vada" view which dominates Indian thought.

===Spread of Tantra===
Tantric movements led to the formation of a number of Hindu and Buddhist esoteric schools. It has influenced the Hindu, Bön, Buddhist and Jain religious traditions and spread with Buddhism to East and Southeast Asia.

===Chronological use of term===
A survey of the literature yields a variety of uses for "tantra":

 Appearance of term \"Tantra\" in scriptures The dates in the left column of the table refer to the appearance of that tradition, even before its transcription, according to the date recognized by most scholars. The table does not include the texts traditionally considered as tantric texts with the exception of Tantrāloka.

==Practices==
Rather than one coherent system, Tantra is an accumulation of practices and ideas. Because of the wide range of communities covered by the term, it is problematic to describe tantric practices definitively.

===Goal===
Tantric ritual seeks to access the supra-mundane through the mundane, identifying the microcosm with the macrocosm. Harper (2002), p. 2. The Tantric aim is to sublimate (rather than negate) reality. The Tantric practitioner seeks to use prana (energy flowing through the universe, including one's body) to attain goals which may be spiritual, material or both. Harper (2002), p. 3. 

===Tantric path===

Long training is generally required to master Tantric methods. Pupils are typically initiated by a guru.

A number of techniques are used as aids for meditation and achieving spiritual power:
* Yoga, including breathing techniques and postures (asana), is employed to balance the energies in the body/mind.
* Mudras, or gestures
* Mantras: Syllables, words and phrases
* Mandalas
* Yantras: Symbolic diagrams of forces at work in the universe
* Identification with deities

The process of sublimation consists of three phases:
# Purification
# Elevation
# "Reaffirmation of identity in pure consciousness" 

===Classification===
Avalon contrasts "ordinary" and "secret ritual". 
Methods employed by Dakshinachara (right-hand path) interpretations of Tantra differ from methods used in the pursuit of the Vamachara (left-hand path).

===Mantra, yantra, nyasa===
The words mantram, tantram and yantram are rooted linguistically and phonologically in ancient Indian traditions. Mantram denotes the chant, or "knowledge." Tantram denotes philosophy, or ritual actions. Yantram denotes the means by which a person is expected to lead their life.

The mantra and yantra are instruments to invoke higher qualities, often associated with specific Hindu deities such as Shiva, Shakti, or Kali. Similarly, puja may involve focusing on a yantra or mandala associated with a deity. Magee, Michael. The Kali Yantra 

Each mantra is associated with a specific Nyasa. Nyasa involves touching various parts of the body at specific parts of the mantra, thought to invoke the deity in the body. There are several types of Nyasas; the most important are Kara Nyasa and Anga Nyasa.

===Identification with deities===
Tantra, as a development of early Hindu-Vedic thought, embraced the Hindu gods and goddesses (especially Shiva and Shakti) and the Advaita philosophy that each represents an aspect of the ultimate Para Brahman or Adi Parashakti. These deities may be worshiped with flowers, incense and other offerings (such as singing and dancing). Tantric practices form the foundation of the ritual temple dance of the devadasis, and are preserved in the Melattur style of Bharatanatyam by Mangudi Dorairaja Iyer.

====Visualisation====
The deities are internalised as attributes of Ishta devata meditations, with practitioners visualizing themselves as the deity or experiencing the darshan (vision) of the deity. During meditation the initiate identifies with any of the Hindu gods and goddesses, visualising and internalising them in a process similar to sexual courtship and consummation. Cavendish, Richard. The Great Religions. New York: Arco Publishing, 1980. The Tantrika practitioner may use visualizations of deities, identifying with a deity to the degree that the aspirant "becomes" the Ishta-deva (or meditational deity). Harper (2002), pp. 3–5. 

====Classes of devotees====
In Hindu Tantra, uniting the deity and the devotee uses meditation and ritual practices. These practices are divided among three classes of devotees: the animal, heroic, and the divine. In the divine devotee, the rituals are internal. The divine devotee is the only one who can attain the object of the rituals (awakening energy). 

===Vanamarga (secret ritual)===
The secret ritual prompted Heinrich Zimmer's praise of Tantra's world-affirming attitude:

Arthur Avalon states that the Panchatattva, Chakrapuja and Panchamakara involve:

Avalon provides a number of variations and substitutions of the Panchatattva (Panchamakara) "elements" or tattva encoded in the Tantras and tantric traditions, affirming a direct correlation to the Tantric Five Nectars and the Mahābhūta. Avalon, Arthur. Sakti and Sakta, ch. 27 

===Sexual rites===

Although equated with Tantra in the West, sexual rites were historically practiced by a minority of sects. For practicing groups, maithuna progressed into psychological symbolism. 

====Origins====
According to White, the sexual rites of Vamamarga may have emerged from early Hindu Tantra as a means of catalyzing biochemical transformations in the body to facilitate heightened states of awareness. White (2000) These constitute an offering to Tantric deities.

====Religious aims====

Later developments in the rite emphasize the primacy of bliss and divine union, which replace the bodily connotations of earlier forms. When enacted as enjoined by the Tantras, the ritual culminates in an experience of awareness for both participants. Tantric texts specify that sex has three distinct purposes: procreation, pleasure and liberation. Those seeking liberation eschew orgasm in favor of a higher form of ecstasy. Several sexual rituals are recommended and practiced, involving elaborate preparatory and purification rites.

The sexual act balances energies in the pranic ida and pingala channels in the bodies of both participants. The sushumna nadi is awakened, and kundalini rises within it. This culminates in samadhi, where the individual personality and identity of each participant is dissolved in cosmic consciousness.

Tantrics understand these acts on multiple levels. The male and female participants are conjoined physically, representing Shiva and Shakti (the male and female principles). A fusion of Shiva and Shakti energies takes place, resulting in a unified energy field. On the individual level, each participant experiences a fusion of their Shiva and Shakti energies. Satyananda, . Woodroffe (1959), . 

==Doctrines==
Defined as a technique-rich style of spiritual practice, Tantra has no single coherent doctrine; instead, it developed a variety of teachings in connection with the religions adopting the Tantric method. These practices are oriented to the married householder rather than the monastic or solitary renunciant, exhibiting a world-embracing (as opposed to a world-denying) character. Tantra, particularly its nondual forms, rejected the values of Patañjalian yoga; instead, it offered a vision of reality as self-expression of a single, free and blissful divine consciousness under Śiva.

===The world is real===
Since the world was seen as real (not illusory), this doctrine was an innovation on previous Indian philosophies (which saw the divine as transcendent and the world as illusion). The consequence of this view was that householders could aspire to spiritual liberation, and were the practitioner addressed by most Tantric manuals.

Since Tantra dissolved the dichotomy between spiritual and mundane, practitioners could integrate their daily lives into their spiritual growth, seeking to realize the divine which is transcendent and immanent. Tantric practices and rituals aim to bring about a realization of the truth that "nothing exists that is not divine" (), bringing freedom from ignorance and the cycle of suffering ().

Tantric visualizations are said to bring the meditator to the core of their humanity and unity with transcendence. Tantric meditations do not serve as training, extraneous beliefs or unnatural practices. On the contrary, the transcendence reached by such meditative work does not construct anything in the mind of the practitioner; instead, it deconstructs all preconceived notions of the human condition. The limits on thought (cultural and linguistic frameworks) are removed. This allows the person to experience liberation, followed by unity with reality. Timalsina, S. (2012) 

===Evolution and involution===
According to Tantra, "being-consciousness-bliss" (or Satchidananda) entails self-evolution and self-involution. Prakriti (reality) evolves into a multiplicity of things but also remains consciousness, being and bliss. Maya (illusion) veils reality, separating it into opposites (conscious and unconscious, pleasant and unpleasant). If not recognized as illusion, these opposing conditions limit (pashu) the individual (jiva). Nikhilanada (1982), pp. 145–160 

Shiva and Shakti are generally seen as distinct. Tantra affirms that the world and the individual jiva are real, distinguishing itself from dualism and the qualified non-dualism of Vedanta. 

Evolution, or the "outgoing current," is only half of Maya. Involution (the "return current") takes the jiva back towards the source of reality, revealing the infinite. Tantra teaches the changing of the "outgoing current" into the "return current," removing the fetters of Maya. This view underscores two maxims of Tantra: "One must rise by that by which one falls," and "the very poison that kills becomes the elixir of life when used by the wise." 

==Scripture==

The primary sources of written Hindu Tantric lore are the agama, generally consisting of four parts: metaphysical knowledge (jnana), contemplative procedures (yoga), ritual regulations (kriya) and religious injunctions (charya). Tantric schools affiliate themselves with specific agamic traditions. Hindu tantra exists in Shaiva, Vaisnava, Bhattacharyya, pp. 182–88. Ganapatya, Bühnemann. Saura Swami Niranjananda, The Tantric Tradition. Yoga Magazine, March 1998 and Shakta forms, and individual tantric texts may be classified as Shaiva , Vaishnava , For as representing tantric Vaishnavism, see: Flood (1996), p. 122. and Shakta Tantras. The word Tantra includes all such works. For terminology of , , and , see: Winternitz, p. 587. 

==Influence on Asian religions==
The Tantric method affected every major Indian religion during the early medieval period (c. 500–1200 CE); the Hindu sects of Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism and also Buddhism and Jainism developed a well-documented body of Tantric practices and doctrines, and Islam in India was also influenced by Tantra. Tantric ideas and practices spread from India to Tibet, Nepal, China, Japan, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia. Tibetan Buddhism and some forms of Hinduism show the strongest Tantric influence, as do the postural yoga movement and most forms of American New Age spirituality.

===Hinduism===

====Vedic tradition====

Orthodox Brahmanas incorporate Tantric rituals into their daily activities (ahnikas). Gayatri-avahanam is a common element of Sandhyavandanam in southern India. Orthodox temple archakas of several sects follow rules laid out in Tantric texts; for example, priests of the Iyengar sect follow Pañcaratra agamas.

However, it has been claimed that orthodox Vedic traditions were inimical to Tantra. André Padoux notes that, in India, tantra rejects orthodox Vedic tenets. Padoux, André, What do we mean by Tantrism? in: Harper (2002), p. 23. In his review of Tantric literature, Moriz Winternitz points out that while Indian Tantric texts are not hostile to the Vedas they see them as too difficult for the modern age. Winternitz, volume 1, p. 587. Many orthodox Brahmans who accept the authority of the Vedas reject the Tantras. Flood (1996), p. 122. Although later Tantric writers wanted to base their doctrines on the Vedas, some orthodox followers of the Vedic tradition denigrated Tantra as anti-Vedic. Bhattacharyya, p. 20. 

====Shaiva Tantra====

The tantric Shaiva tradition consists of the Kapalikas, Kashmir Shaivism and Shaiva Siddhanta. The word "Tāntrika" is used for followers of the Tantras in Shaivism.

====Yoga====

Shaiva tantra produced the Hatha Yoga manuals, such as the 15th-century Hathayoga Pradīpikā and the 16th-century Gheranda Samhitā, from which modern yoga derives. The earlier (pre-Tantric) form of yoga, dating back to the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, became known as Raja Yoga:

===Buddhist Tantra===

Vajrayana includes scriptures written by the Indian Mahasiddhas. Beer, Robert (1999). The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs, (Hardcover). Shambhala Publications. ISBN 1-57062-416-X, ISBN 978-1-57062-416-2 pg. 250 According to Tibetan Buddhist Tantric master Lama Thubten Yeshe:
...each one of us is a union of all universal energy. Everything that we need in order to be complete is within us right at this very moment. It is simply a matter of being able to recognize it. This is the tantric approach. 

==Western views==
The Sri Yantra (shown here in the three-dimensional projection known as Sri Meru or Maha Meru, used primarily by Srividya Shakta sects) is central to most Tantric forms of Shaktism.

===John Woodroffe===
The first Western scholar to seriously study Tantra was John Woodroffe (1865–1936), who wrote about Tantra under the pen name Arthur Avalon and is known as the "founding father of Tantric studies". Urban (2003), p. 22 Unlike previous Western scholars Woodroffe advocated for Tantra, defending and presenting it as an ethical and philosophical system in accord with the Vedas and Vedanta. Urban (2003), p. 135 Woodroffe practised Tantra and, while trying to maintain scholastic objectivity, was a student of Hindu Tantra (the Shiva-Shakta tradition). : See Arthur Avalon, trans. Tantra of the Great Liberation: Mahanirvana Tantra (London: Luzac & Co., 1913); Avalon, ed. Principles of Tantra: the Tantratattva of Shriyukta Shiva Chandra Vidyarnava Bhattacharyya Mahodaya (London: Luzac & Co., 1914–16); Woodroffe, Shakti and Shakta: Essays and Addresses on the Shakta Tantrashastra (London : Luzac & Co., 1918) 

===Further development===
Following Woodroffe a number of scholars began investigating Tantric teachings, including scholars of comparative religion and Indology such as Agehananda Bharati, Mircea Eliade, Julius Evola, Carl Jung, Giuseppe Tucci and Heinrich Zimmer. Urban (2003), pp. 165–166 According to Hugh Urban, Zimmer, Evola and Eliade viewed Tantra as "the culmination of all Indian thought: the most radical form of spirituality and the archaic heart of aboriginal India", regarding it as the ideal religion for the modern era. All three saw Tantra as "the most transgressive and violent path to the sacred". Urban (2003), pp. 166–167 

===Modern world===
Following these first Tantric presentations, popular authors (such as Joseph Campbell) brought Tantra to the attention of Westerners. It was seen as a "cult of ecstasy", combining sexuality and spirituality to correct Western repressive attitudes towards sex. For "cult of ecstasy" see: Urban (2003), pp. 204–205. 

As Tantra has become more popular in the West, it has undergone a transformation. For many readers Tantra is synonymous with "spiritual sex" or "sacred sexuality," a belief that sex should be recognized as a sacred act capable of elevating its participants to a higher spiritual plane. For "Tantra" as a synonym for "spiritual sex" or "sacred sexuality," see: Urban (2003), pp. 204–205 Although Neotantra uses many concepts and terminology of Indian Tantra, it often omits one (or more) of the following: reliance on guruparampara (the guidance of a guru), meditation and moral and ritual rules of conduct.

According to author and critic of religion and politics Hugh Urban:

Urban says he does not consider this "wrong" or "false", but "simply a different interpretation for a specific historical situation." Urban (2003), pp. 204–205 

Responding to criticism of modern Western Tantra, Geoffrey Samuel, a historian of Indian and Tibetan Tantra writes:
