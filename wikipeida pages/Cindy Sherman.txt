[[Cindy Sherman]]

Cynthia "Cindy" Morris Sherman (born January 19, 1954) is an American photographer and film director, best known for her conceptual portraits. In 1995, she was the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship. Through a number of different series of works, Sherman has sought to raise challenging and important questions about the role and representation of women in society, the media and the nature of the creation of art. Her photographs include some of the most expensive photographs ever sold. Sherman lives and works in New York.

== Early life and education ==
Cindy Sherman was born on January 19, 1954 in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, the youngest of five children. Cindy Sherman, Encyclopædia Britannica. Genocchio, Benjamin. "ART REVIEW; Portraits of the Artist as an Actor", The New York Times, April 4, 2004. Accessed May 21, 2012. "Ms. Sherman was born in Glen Ridge; when she was 3, her family moved to Huntington Beach on Long Island." Simon Hattenstone (15 January 2011), Sherman: Me, myself and I The Guardian. Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the township of Huntington, Long Island, where her father worked as an engineer for Grumman Aircraft. Carol Vogel (February 16, 2012), Cindy Sherman Unmasked New York Times. Her mother taught children with learning difficulties to read. 

Sherman became interested in the visual arts at Buffalo State College, where she began painting. Frustrated with what she saw as the medium's limitations, she abandoned the form and took up photography. "here was nothing more to say painting," she later recalled. "I was meticulously copying other art and then I realized I could just use a camera and put my time into an idea instead." Sherman has said about this time: "One of the reasons I started photographing myself was that supposedly in the spring one of my teachers would take the class out to a place near Buffalo where there were waterfalls and everybody romps around without clothes on and takes pictures of each other. I thought, ‘Oh, I don’t want to do this. But if we’re going to have to go to the woods I better deal with it early.’ Luckily we never had to do that." She spent the remainder of her college education focused on photography. Though Sherman had failed a required photography class as a freshman, she repeated the course with Barbara Jo Revelle, whom she credits with introducing her to conceptual art and other contemporary forms. While in college she also met Robert Longo, who encouraged her to record her process of "dolling up" for parties. Michael Small (November 30, 1987), Photographer Cindy Sherman Shoots Her Best Model—Herself People. 

Together with Charles Clough, Robert Longo and Nancy Dwyer, Sherman created Hallwalls, an arts center. The center was a snapshot of Buffalo in the late 1970s, a city which had gained a reputation as a model laboratory for artists interested in dismantling boundaries between media. Besides Hallwalls and the wealth of classes and programs in the arts supplied by the two Buffalo campuses of the SUNY school system, Sherman was exposed to the contemporary art exhibited at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Media Studies Buffalo, the Center for Exploratory and Perceptual Arts, and Artpark, in nearby Lewiston, N.Y., where she was privy to the fluid exchange of influences among the artists, curators and programmers working at all these venues and in all the exhibited media. G. Roger Denson (March 5, 2012), Cindy Sherman as Orson Welles... as John Ford... as Vittorio De Sica... as Alfred Hitchcock... Huffington Post. It was in Buffalo that Sherman also encountered the photo-based Conceptual works of artists Hannah Wilke, Eleanor Antin, and Adrian Piper.

Sherman works in series, typically photographing herself in a range of costumes. To create her photographs, Sherman shoots alone in her studio, assuming multiple roles as author, director, make-up artist, hairstylist, wardrobe mistress, and model.

=== Early work ===
Bus Riders (1976/2000) is a series of photographs that feature the artist as a variety of meticulously observed characters. The photographs were shot in 1976 and are among the artist's earliest work but, like another series entitled Murder Mystery People, were not printed or exhibited until 2000. Sherman uses elaborate costumes and make-up to transform her identity for each image, but is photographed in a sparse, obviously staged setting with a wooden chair standing in for the bus seat. In her landmark 69-photograph series, the Complete Untitled Film Stills (1977–1980; although the 1997 traveling MOCA retrospective included five straight-on head shots dated 1975), Sherman appeared as B-movie, foreign film and film noir style actresses. When asked if she considers herself to be acting in her photographs, Sherman said, “I never thought I was acting. When I became involved with close-ups I needed more information in the expression. I couldn’t depend on background or atmosphere. I wanted the story to come from the face. Somehow the acting just happened.” Sussler, Betsy http://bombsite.com/issues/12/articles/638 “Cindy Sherman” in BOMB Magazine Spring 1985, Retrieved August 10, 2011 

Many of Sherman's photo-series, like the 1981 Centerfolds, call attention to the stereotyping of women in films, television and magazines. When talking about one of her centerfold pictures Cindy stated, "In content I wanted a man opening up the magazine suddenly look at it with an expectation of something lascivious and then feel like the violator that they would be. Looking at this woman who is perhaps a victim. I didn't think of them as victims at the time... But I suppose... Obviously I'm trying to make someone feel bad for having a certain expectation." http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsow0QaKJAM 

She explained to the New York Times in 1990, "I feel I'm anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren't self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear." New York Times, 1 February 1990, "A Portraitist's Romp Through Art History." She describes her process as intuitive, and that she responds to elements of a setting such as light, mood, location, and costume, and will continue to change external elements until she finds what she wants. She has said of her process, "I think of becoming a different person. I look into a mirror next to the camera…it’s trance-like. By staring into it I try to become that character through the lens...When I see what I want, my intuition takes over—both in the 'acting' and in the editing. Seeing that other person that’s up there, that’s what I want. It’s like magic.” 

=== The Untitled Film Stills ===
The series Untitled Film Stills, 1977–1980, with which Cindy Sherman achieved international recognition, consists of 69 black-and-white photographs. The artist poses in different roles and settings (streets, yards, pools, beaches, and interiors), Lance Esplund (February 27, 2012), Cindy Sherman Self-Portraits Offer Empty Entertainment: Review Bloomberg. producing a result reminiscent of stills typical of Italian neorealism or American film noir of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Cindy Sherman, December 2, 2006 - January 28, 2007 Kunsthaus Bregenz. She avoided putting titles on the images to preserve their ambiguity. Victoria Olsen (March 2009), Cindy Sherman: Monument Valley Girl Smithsonian Magazine. Modest in scale compared to Sherman’s later cibachrome photographs, they are all 8 1/2 by 11 inches, each displayed in identical, simple black frames. Helen Molesworth, Cindy Sherman's Untitled Film Stills twenty years later Frieze Magazine, Issue 36, September–October 1997. 
Sherman used her own possessions as props, or sometimes borrowed, as in Untitled Film Still #11 in which the doggy pillow belongs to a friend. The shots were also largely taken in her own apartment.
The Untitled Film Stills fall into several distinct groups:
* The first six are grainy and slightly out of focus (e.g. Untitled #4), and each of the 'roles' appears to be played by the same blonde actress.
* The next group was taken in 1978 at Robert Longo's family beach house on the north fork of Long Island. (Sherman met Longo during her sophomore year, and they were a couple until late 1979)
* Later in 1978, Sherman began taking shots in outdoor locations around the city. E.g. Untitled Film Still #21
* Sherman later returned to her apartment, preferring to work from home. She created her version of a Sophia Loren character from the movie Two Women. (E.g. Untitled Film Still #35 (1979)) 
* She took several photographs in the series while preparing for a road trip to Arizona with her parents. Untitled Film Still #48 (1979), also known as The Hitchhiker, was shot by Sherman’s father Simon Schama (February 3, 2012), Cindy Sherman talks to Simon Schama Financial Times. at sunset one evening during the trip.
* The remainder of the series was shot around New York, like Untitled #54, often featuring a blonde victim typical of film noir.
Sherman eventually completed the series in 1980. She stopped, she has explained, when she ran out of clichés. In December 1995, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, acquired all sixty-nine black-and-white photographs in Sherman's Untitled Film Stills series Cindy Sherman: The Complete Untitled Film Stills, June 26 - September 2, 1997 MoMA. for an estimated $1 million. Barry Schwabsky (April 18, 1999), A Photographer's Many Faces New York Times. 

=== 1980s ===
In addition to her film stills, Sherman has appropriated a number of other visual forms— the centerfold, fashion photograph, historical portrait, and soft-core sex image. These and other series, like the 1980s "Fairy Tales and Disasters" sequence, were shown for the first time at the Metro Pictures Gallery in New York City.

During the 1980s Sherman began to use colour film, to exhibit very large prints, and to concentrate more on lighting and facial expression. It was with her series Rear Screen Projections, 1980, that Sherman switched from black-and-white to color and to clearly larger formats. Centerfolds/Horizontals, 1981, are inspired by the center spreads in fashion and pornographic magazines. The twelve (24 by 48 inches) photographs were initially commissioned — but not used — by Artforum's Editor in Chief Ingrid Sischy for an artist's section in the magazine. Close-cropped and close up, they portray young women in various roles, from a sultry seductress to a frightened, vulnerable victim who might have just been raped. Grace Glueck (May 23, 2003), Cindy Sherman -- 'Centerfolds, 1981' New York Times. Sherman poses either on the floor or in bed, usually recumbent and often supine. Andy Grundberg (November 22, 1981), Cindy Sherman: A Playful and Political Post-Modernist New York Times. Due to the artist's proximity to the camera and to the larger-than-life scale she assumes in the prints, her corporeal presence is emphasized. About her aims with the self-portraits, Sherman has said: "Some of them I’d hope would seem very psychological. While I’m working I might feel as tormented as the person I’m portraying.” In Fairy Tales, 1985, and Disasters, 1986–1989, Cindy Sherman uses visible prostheses and mannequins for the first time. Provoked by the 1989 NEA funding controversy involving photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, as well as the way Jeff Koons modelled his porn star wife in his "Made in Heaven" series, Sherman produced the Sex series in 1989. For once she removed herself from the shots, as these photographs featured pieced-together medical dummies in flagrante delicto.

=== Sex Pictures ===
Cindy Sherman uses prosthetic limbs and mannequins to create her Sex Pictures series (1992). Sherman is revealing the objectification of women through the mannequin’s positions (open legs and visible vaginas) but is also implementing a male aspect by assembling the mannequins with either androgynous or unambiguous male heads. The mannequins’ within the series appear passive and mirror a pornographic photo. Sherman is clearly commenting on gender roles within society as she consciously removed herself from this series to evoke greater dialogue than her earlier works. It is truly surprising that Sherman has omitted herself as the subject in this series (in comparison to her earlier work). However, It is apparent that Sherman’s series Sex Pictures has been alienated from journals and articles written by well-respected art critics.

Hal Foster, an American art critic describes Sherman’s Sex Pictures in his article Obscene, Abject, Traumatic as “n this scheme of things the impulse to erode the subject and to tear at the screen has driven Sherman to her recent work, where it is obliterated by the gaze.” Foster, Hal. "Obscene, Abject, Traumatic." Obscene, Abject, Traumatic 78 (1996): 106-24. Print. 15 Nov.2013. Moreover, Abigail Solomon- Godeau, a photo critic who teaches art history at the University of California illustrates Sherman’s work in Suitable for Framing: The Critical Recasting of Cindy Sherman. Solomon-Godeau writes, “ pictures have struck many viewers as centrally concerned with the problematics of femininity (as role, as image, as spectacle), more recent interpretation now finds them redolent with allusion to “our common humanity,” revealing “a progression through the deserts of human condition.” Solomon-Godeau, Abigail. "Suitable for Framing: The Critical Recasting of Cindy Sherman." (1991): 112-15. Web. 15 Nov. 2013. 

However, it is Jerry Saltz, an art critic who told New York magazine that Sherman’s work is “ashioned from dismembered and recombined mannequins, some adorned with pubic hair, one posed with a tampon in vagina, another with sausages being excreted from vulva, this was anti-porn porn, the unsexiest sex pictures ever made, visions of feigning, fighting, perversion. … Today, I think of Cindy Sherman as an artist who only gets better.” Lindemann, Adam. "All Hail Cindy Sherman! Once Again, Unanimity Rules Among New York’s Longtime Critics." Gallerist. N.p., 13 Mar. 2012. Web. 15 Nov. 2013. Saltz’s commentary gives life to Sherman’s mannequins who were presented as a symbolic declaration of the objectification of women within a man’s world.

Finally, Greg Fallis of Utata Tribal Photography describes Sherman’s Sex Pictures series and her work as the following,"he progression of her work reflects more than a progression of ideology. It also demonstrates a progression in approach. Sherman’s initial photographs used relatively few props—just clothing. As her photographs became more sophisticated, so did her props. During her Centerfold series, she began to incorporate prosthetic body part culled from the pages of medical educational catalogs. Each new series tended to utilize more prosthetics and less of Sherman herself. By the time she began the Sex Pictures series, the photographs were exclusively of prosthetic body parts. With her Sex Pictures Sherman posed medical prostheses in sexualized positions, recreating—and strangely modifying—pornography. They are a comment on the intersection of art and taste, they are a comment on pornography and the way porn objectifies the men and women who pose for it, they are a comment on social discomfort with overt sexuality, and they are a comment on the relationship between sex and violence. Yet the emphasis is still on creating a striking image that seems simultaneously familiar and strange." Utata's Sunday Salon Fallis, Greg. "Sunday Salon with Greg Fallis." Sunday Salon Cindy Sherman. N.p., n.d. Web. 29 Oct. 2013. 

=== Recent projects ===
Between 1989 and 1990, Sherman made 35 large, color photographs restaging the settings of various European portrait paintings of the fifteenth through early 19th centuries. Under the title History Portraits Sherman photographed herself in costumes flanked with props and prosthetics portraying famous artistic figures of the past, like Raphael’s La Fornarina, Caravaggio’s Sick Bacchus and Judith Beheading Holofernes, or Jean Fouquet’s Madonna of Melun.

Cloutier-Blazzard, Cindy Sherman: Her “History Portrait” Series as Post-Modern Parody, Bread and Circus, 29 July 2007 Between 2003 and 2004, she produced the Clowns cycle, where the use of digital photography enabled her to create chromatically garish backdrops and montages of numerous characters. Set against opulent backdrops and presented in ornate frames, the characters in Sherman’s 2008 untitled Society Portraits are not based on specific women, but the artist has made them look entirely familiar in their struggle with the standards of beauty that prevail in a youth- and status-obsessed culture. Her MoMA exhibition in 2012 also premiered a created photographic mural (2010–11) that represents the artist's first foray into transforming space through site-specific fictive environments. In the mural, Sherman transforms her face digitally, exaggerating her features through Photoshop by elongating her nose, narrowing her eyes, or creating smaller lips.

In 1997, singer Madonna sponsored the exhibition "Cindy Sherman: The Complete Untitled Film Stills" at the Museum of Modern Art. Sherman has been referenced by the electroclash artists Chicks on Speed in the track "Spoken by Stephanie from Marseille, Yes I Do" from the 2000 K Records album The Re-Releases of the Un-Releases. The song refers to Sherman through the lyrics, "...got more faces than Cindy Sherman." Sherman was also the topic of the song Cindy of a Thousand Lives, from Billy Bragg's 1991 album Don't Try This at Home. Also, the Cherry Poppin' Daddies' song Grand Mal contains a reference to Sherman's work in the description of the narrator's love interest: "She takes Cindy Sherman pictures/And she cuts herself." She is the subject of The Shermans' song, Cindy Sherman. Singer Róisín Murphy said that the music video for her song You Know Me Better (2008) is inspired by Sherman, as well as to having been influenced by her visual style throughout her career.

==Quotes==

* "I think people are more apt to believe photographs, especially if it’s something fantastic. They’re willing to be more gullible. Sometimes they want fantasy. Even if they know it’s fake they can believe anything. People are accustomed to being told what to believe in." Interview, "Cindy Sherman", BOMB Magazine, Spring 1985 
* "While I'm working I might feel as tormented as the person I'm portraying." 
* "I can’t work without it {Sherman talking about her need to have music on while working}. And it has to be the right kind, because if it’s not then I get into a bad mood. I work with a remote so that I can change CDs instantly if I need to."
* "I didn't want to make 'high' art, I had no interest in using paint, I wanted to find something that anyone could relate to without knowing about contemporary art. I wasn't thinking in terms of precious prints or archival quality; I didn't want the work to seem like a commodity."
* "I was supporting myself, but nothing like the guy painters, as I refer to them. I always resented that actually.. we were all getting the same amount of press, but they were going gangbusters with sales."
* "When I do work, I get so much done in such a concentrated time that once I’m through a series, I’m so drained I don’t want to get near the camera."
* "I was feeling guilty in the beginning; it was frustrating to be successful when a lot of my friends weren’t. Also, I was constantly being reminded of that by people in my family making jokes."
* "If I knew what the picture was going to be like I wouldn’t make it. It was almost like it was made already... the challenge is more about trying to make what you can’t think of."
* "The work is what it is and hopefully it’s seen as feminist work, or feminist-advised work, but I’m not going to go around espousing theoretical bullshit about feminist stuff."
