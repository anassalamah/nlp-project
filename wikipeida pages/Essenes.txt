[[Essenes]]

The Essenes (in Modern Hebrew: , Isiyim; Greek: Εσσήνοι, Εσσαίοι, or Οσσαίοι, Essḗnoi, Essaíoi, Ossaíoi) were a sect of Second Temple Judaism that flourished from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE which some scholars claim seceded from the Zadokite priests. F.F. Bruce, Second Thoughts on the Dead Sea Scrolls. Paternoster Press, 1956. Being much fewer in number than the Pharisees and the Sadducees (the other two major sects at the time), the Essenes lived in various cities but congregated in communal life dedicated to asceticism (some groups practiced celibacy), voluntary poverty, and daily immersion. Many separate but related religious groups of that era shared similar mystic, eschatological, messianic, and ascetic beliefs. These groups are collectively referred to by various scholars as the "Essenes." Josephus records that Essenes existed in large numbers, and thousands lived throughout Roman Judæa.

The Essenes have gained fame in modern times as a result of the discovery of an extensive group of religious documents known as the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are commonly believed to be Essenes' library—although there is no proof that the Essenes wrote them. These documents include preserved multiple copies of parts of the Hebrew Bible untouched from possibly as early as 300 BCE until their discovery in 1946. Some scholars, however, dispute the notion that the Essenes wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls. Hillel Newman, Ph.D Bar Ilan University : Proximity to Power and Jewish Sectarian Groups of the Ancient Period Brill ISBN 90-04-14699-7. Rachel Elior questions even the existence of the Essenes. 

The first reference is by the Roman writer Pliny the Elder (died ) in his Natural History. cf. English translation. Pliny relates in a few lines that the Essenes do not marry, possess no money, and had existed for thousands of generations. Unlike Philo, who did not mention any particular geographical location of the Essenes other than the whole land of Israel, Pliny places them in Ein Gedi, next to the Dead Sea.

A little later Josephus gave a detailed account of the Essenes in The Jewish War (), with a shorter description in Antiquities of the Jews () and The Life of Flavius Josephus (). Claiming first hand knowledge, he lists the Essenoi as one of the three sects of Jewish philosophy Josephus (). The Wars of the Jews. 2.119. alongside the Pharisees and the Sadducees. He relates the same information concerning piety, celibacy, the absence of personal property and of money, the belief in communality and commitment to a strict observance of Sabbath. He further adds that the Essenes ritually immersed in water every morning, ate together after prayer, devoted themselves to charity and benevolence, forbade the expression of anger, studied the books of the elders, preserved secrets, and were very mindful of the names of the angels kept in their sacred writings.

Pliny, also a geographer, located them in the desert near the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in the year 1947 by Muhammed edh-Dhib and Ahmed Mohammed, two Bedouin shepherds of the Ta'amireh tribe. 

== Name ==
Josephus uses the name Essenes in his two main accounts Josephus. The Wars of the Jews. 2.119, 158, 160. Josephus. Antiquities of the Jews. 13.171-2. as well as in some other contexts ("an account of the Essenes"; Josephus. Antiquities of the Jews. 13.298. "the gate of the Essenes"; Josephus. The Wars of the Jews. 5.145. "Judas of the Essene race"; Josephus. Antiquities of the Jews. 13.311. but some manuscripts read here Essaion; "holding the Essenes in honour"; Josephus (). Antiquities of the Jews. 15.372. "a certain Essene named Manaemus"; Josephus. Antiquities of the Jews. 15.373. "to hold all Essenes in honor"; Josephus. Antiquities of the Jews. 15.378. "the Essenes"). Josephus. Antiquities of the Jews. 18.11. Josephus. Antiquities of the Jews. 18.18. Josephus. The Life of Flavius Josephus. 10. 

In several places, however, Josephus has Essaios, which is usually assumed to mean Essene ("Judas of the Essaios race"; Josephus. The Wars of the Jews. I.78. "Simon of the Essaios race"; Josephus. The Wars of the Jews. 2.113. "John the Essaios"; Josephus. The Wars of the Jews. 2.567; 3.11. "those who are called by us Essaioi"; Josephus. Antiquities of the Jews. 15.371. "Simon a man of the Essaios race"). Josephus. Antiquities of the Jews. 17.346. Josephus identified the Essenes as one of the three major Jewish sects of that period. And when I was about sixteen years old, I had a mind to make trim of the several sects that were among us. These sects are three: - The first is that of the Pharisees, the second that Sadducees, and the third that of the Essenes, as we have frequently told you - The Life of Josephus Flavius, 2. 

Philo's usage is Essaioi, although he admits this Greek form of the original name that according to his etymology signifies "holiness" to be inexact. Philo. Quod Omnis Probus Liber. XII.75-87. Pliny's Latin text has Esseni. Pliny the Elder. Natural History. 5.73. 

Gabriele Boccaccini implies that a convincing etymology for the name Essene has not been found, but that the term applies to a larger group within Palestine that also included the Qumran community. 

It was proposed before the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered that the name came into several Greek spellings from a Hebrew self-designation later found in some Dead Sea Scrolls, osey hatorah, "observers of torah." Although dozens of etymology suggestions have been published, this is the only etymology published before 1947 that was confirmed by Qumran text self-designation references, and it is gaining acceptance among scholars. For example, James C. VanderKam, "Identity and History of the Community." In The Dead Sea Scrolls after Fifty Years: A Comprehensive Assessment, ed. Peter W. Flint and James C. VanderKam, 2:487–533. Leiden: Brill, 1999. The earliest known proposer of this etymology was P. Melanchthon, in Johann Carion, Chronica, 1532, folio 68 verso. Among the other proposers before 1947, e.g., 1839 Isaak Jost, "Die Essaer," Israelitische Annalen 19, 145–7. It is recognized as the etymology of the form Ossaioi (and note that Philo also offered an O spelling) and Essaioi and Esseni spelling variations have been discussed by VanderKam, Goranson and others. In medieval Hebrew (e.g. Sefer Yosippon) Hassidim ("the pious ones") replaces "Essenes". While this Hebrew name is not the etymology of Essaioi/Esseni, the Aramaic equivalent Hesi'im known from Eastern Aramaic texts has been suggested. Others suggest that Essene is a transliteration of the Hebrew word chitzonim (chitzon=outside), which the Mishna (e.g. Megila 4:8) uses to describe various sectarian groups. Another theory is that the name was borrowed from a cult of devotees to Artemis in Asia Minor, whose demeanor and dress somewhat resembled those of the group in Judaea. Essenes, Lawrence H. Schiffman, Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls, Jewish Publication Society, Philadelphia, 1994. 

However, Flavius Josephus – born Yosef ben Mattathias – was the son of a priestly family on both sides and a self-described Pharisee. Whiston and Maier, 1999, Introduction, p.8 "From ages sixteen to nineteen, according to his autobiography, Josephus experimented with the various Jewish sects in order to choose the best, finally deciding on the Pharisees as the most attuned to the people. In an apparent chronological conflict, however, Josephus also states that he spent these three years with a desert ascetic named Bannus, a period that ended when he was nineteen." Ibid. We come to understand his true feelings about these so-called "Essenes" in Chapter 8 of "The Jewish War" as follows:

:"2.(119)For there are three philosophical sects among the Jews. The followers of the first of which are the Pharisees; of the second, the Sadducees; and the third sect, which pretends (italicized for emphasis) to a severer discipline, are called Essenes. These last are Jews by birth, and seem to have a greater affection for each other than other sects have." Whiston and Maier, 1999, "The Jewish War" - Chapter 8, p.736 

== Location ==
Remains of part of the main building at Qumran.
According to Josephus, the Essenes had settled "not in one city" but "in large numbers in every town". Josephus (). The Wars of the Jews. 2.124. Philo speaks of "more than four thousand" Essaioi living in "Palestine and Syria", Philo (). Quod Omnis Probus Liber. XII.75. more precisely, "in many cities of Judaea and in many villages and grouped in great societies of many members". Philo. Hypothetica. 11.1. in Eusebius. Praeparatio Evangelica. VIII. 

Pliny locates them "on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the coast… the town of Engeda". 

Some modern scholars and archaeologists have argued that Essenes inhabited the settlement at Qumran, a plateau in the Judean Desert along the Dead Sea, citing Pliny the Elder in support, and giving credence that the Dead Sea Scrolls are the product of the Essenes. This theory, though not yet conclusively proven, has come to dominate the scholarly discussion and public perception of the Essenes. Ellegård, Alvar; Jesus – One Hundred Years Before Christ: A Study in Creative Mythology, (London 1999). 

Josephus' reference to a "gate of the Essenes" in his description of the course of "the most ancient" of the three walls of Jerusalem, in the Mount Zion area, cf. map of ancient Jerusalem. perhaps suggests an Essene community living in this quarter of the city or regularly gathering at this part of the Temple precincts.

== Rules, customs, theology and beliefs ==
The accounts by Josephus and Philo show that the Essenes led a strictly communal lifeoften compared by scholars to later Christian monastic living. Many of the Essene groups appear to have been celibate, but Josephus speaks also of another "order of Essenes" that observed the practice of being engaged for three years and then becoming married. Josephus (). The Wars of the Jews. book II, chap.8, para.13. According to Josephus, they had customs and observances such as collective ownership, Josephus (). The Wars of the Jews. 2.122. Josephus (). Antiquities of the Jews. 18.20. electing a leader to attend to the interests of the group, and obedience to the orders from their leader. Josephus (). The Wars of the Jews. 2.123, 134. Also, they were forbidden from swearing oaths Josephus (). The Wars of the Jews. 2.135. and from sacrificing animals. Philo, §75 They controlled their tempers and served as channels of peace, carrying weapons only for protection against robbers. Josephus (). The Wars of the Jews. 2.125. The Essenes chose not to possess slaves but served each other Josephus (). Antiquities of the Jews. 18.21. and, as a result of communal ownership, did not engage in trading. Josephus (). The Wars of the Jews. 2.127. Josephus and Philo provide lengthy accounts of their communal meetings, meals and religious celebrations.

After a total of three years' probation, Josephus (). The Wars of the Jews. 2.137–138. Josephus' mention of the three-year duration of the Essene probation may be compared with the phased character of the entrance procedure in the Qumran Rule of the Community at least two years plus an indeterminate initial catechetical phase, 1QS VI. The provisional surrender of property required at the beginning of the last year of the novitiate derives from actual social experience of the difficulties of sharing property in a fully communitarian setting, cf. Brian J. Capper, 'The Interpretation of Acts 5.4', Journal for the Study of the New Testament 19 (1983) pp. 117-131; idem, '"In der Hand des Ananias." Erwägungen zu 1QS VI,20 und der urchristlichen Gütergemeinschaft', Revue de Qumran 12(1986) 223-236; Eyal Regev, “Comparing Sectarian Practice and Organization: The Qumran Sect in Light of the Regulations of the Shakers, Hutterites, Mennonites and Amish”, Numen 51 (2004), pp. 146-181. newly joining members would take an oath that included the commitment to practice piety towards "the Deity" (το θειον) and righteousness towards humanity, to maintain a pure lifestyle, to abstain from criminal and immoral activities, to transmit their rules uncorrupted and to preserve the books of the Essenes and the names of the Angels. Josephus (). The Wars of the Jews. 2.139–142. Their theology included belief in the immortality of the soul and that they would receive their souls back after death. Josephus (). The Wars of the Jews. 2.153–158. Part of their activities included purification by water rituals, which was supported by rainwater catchment and storage.

Ritual purification was a common practice among the peoples of Palestine during this period and was thus not specific to the Essenes. Ritual baths are found near many Synagogues of the period. Purity and cleanliness was considered so important to the Essenes that they would refrain from defecation on the Sabbath. http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_a4hAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=essenes+defecate+sabbath&source=bl&ots=LGqywrrjsl&sig=uhzP4s-3Ecm8FWCeEZ54Yk6sjEE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=K4CjUvmgGcWh0QWewICICQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=essenes%20defecate%20sabbath&f=false 

The Church Father Epiphanius (writing in the 4th century CE) seems to make a distinction between two main groups within the Essenes: "Of those that came before his an Ossaean prophet time and during it, the Ossaeans and the Nazarean." Epiphanius of Salamis (). Panarion. 1:19. Epiphanius describes each group as following:

If it is correct to identify the community at Qumran with the Essenes (and claim that the community at Qumran are the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls), then according to the Dead Sea Scrolls the Essenes' community school was called "Yahad" (meaning "community") in order to differentiate themselves from the rest of the Jews who are repeatedly labeled "The Breakers of the Covenant".

== Scholarly discussion ==

The Essenes are discussed in detail by Josephus and Philo. Most scholars believe that the community at Qumran that allegedly produced the Dead Sea Scrolls was an offshoot of the Essenes; however, this theory has been disputed by some, for example, by Norman Golb:

Golb argues that the primary research on the Qumran documents and ruins (by Father Roland de Vaux, from the École Biblique et Archéologique de Jérusalem) lacked scientific method, and drew wrong conclusions that comfortably entered the academic canon. For Golb, the amount of documents is too extensive and includes many different writing styles and calligraphies; the ruins seem to have been a fortress, used as a military base for a very long period of timeincluding the 1st centuryso they could not have been inhabited by the Essenes; and the large graveyard excavated in 1870, just 50 metres east of the Qumran ruins was made of over 1200 tombs that included many women and childrenPliny clearly wrote that the Essenes that lived near the Dead Sea "had not one woman, had renounced all pleasure ... and no one was born in their race". Golb's book presents observations about de Vaux's premature conclusions and their uncontroverted acceptance by the general academic community. He states that the documents probably stemmed from various libraries in Jerusalem, kept safe in the desert from the Roman invasions. 

Other scholars refute these arguments—particularly since Josephus describes some Essenes as allowing marriage. 

Another issue is the relationship between the Essaioi and Philo's Therapeutae and Therapeutrides. It may be argued that he regarded the Therapeutae as a contemplative branch of the Essaioi who, he said, pursued an active life. Philo. De Vita Contemplativa. I.1. 

One theory on the formation of the Essenes suggests that the movement was founded by a Jewish high priest, dubbed by the Essenes the Teacher of Righteousness, whose office had been usurped by Jonathan (of priestly but not of Zadokite lineage), labeled the "man of lies" or "false priest". Others follow this line and a few argue that the Teacher of Righteousness was not only the leader of the Essenes at Qumran, but was also identical to the original Jesus about 150 years before the time of the Gospels. Lawrence Schiffman has argued that the Qumran community may be called Sadducean, and not Essene, since their legal positions retain a link with Sadducean tradition. James VanderKam and Peter Flint, The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls, p.251. 

The Saint Thomas Christians ("Nasrani") of southwestern India may have connections with the Essenes, according to the Manimekalai, one of the great Tamil epic poems, which refers to a people called "Issani". Manimekalai, by Merchant Prince Shattan, Gatha 27 The high presence of Cohen DNA amongst today's Nazareans make further support to the full or part Essene origin of the Malabar Nazareans. The Essenes were often of Levite or Cohen heritage and this may further explain the frequent 'priestly heritage' claims of several Nazerean families of India. Weil, S. (1982)"Symmetry between Christians and Jews in India: The Cananite Christians and Cochin Jews of Kerala. Contributions to Indian Sociology. 

== Connections with Kabbalah ==
According to a Jewish legend, one of the Essenes, named Menachem, had passed at least some of his mystical knowledge to the Talmudic mystic Nehunya ben HaKanah, to whom the Kabbalistic tradition attributes Sefer HaBahir and, by some opinions, Sefer HaKanah, Sefer HaPeliah and Sefer HaTemunah. Some Essene rituals, such as daily immersion in the mikveh, coincide with contemporary Hasidic practices; some historians have also suggested that the name "Essene" is a Hellenized form of the word "Hasidim" or "Hasid" ("pious ones"). However, the legendary connections between Essene and Kabbalistic tradition are not verified by modern historians.

== Essenes in modern times ==
There are several modern Essene movements that sprung up before and after the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls that are modeled on the Ancient Essene Order. The Order of the Essenes founded by Grace Mann Brown at the turn of the 19th-20th century, Rosicrucianism took it under its curriculum.

The Order of the Nazorean Essenes, founded in the United States by Abba Yesai Nasrai (Davied Asia Israel) in 1981, is a syncretic school of religious thought which draws on Nazarean, Gnostic Christian, Buddhist, and Manichaean beliefs and practices. 

In Quebec, Canada and in France there is a French movement named The Essene Spirit which was founded by Olivier Manitara. 

In the United States there are several new Essene movements and Essene churches. 

Edmund Bordeaux Szekely published the modern pseudepigrapha 'Essene Gospel of John' from 1936, based on a claim to have discovered The Essene Gospel of Peace, the existence of which is denied by the libraries where Szekely claimed to have found it.
