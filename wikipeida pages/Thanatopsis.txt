[[Thanatopsis]]

"Thanatopsis" is a poem by the American poet William Cullen Bryant.

==Overview==
The title comes from the Greek thanatos ("death") and opsis ("sight"); it has often been translated as "Meditation upon Death". Bryant wrote the bulk of the poem in 1811 at age 17, and it was first published in 1817 by the North American Review. He added the introductory and concluding lines 10 years later in 1821.

==Critical reception==
Due to the unusual quality of the verse and Bryant's age, Richard Henry Dana, Sr., then associate editor at the Review, initially doubted its authenticity, saying to another editor, "No one, on this side of the Atlantic, is capable of writing such verses."

"Thanatopsis" remains a significant milestone in American literary history. It was republished in 1821 as the lead poem of Thanatopsis and Other Poems, which was considered by many to be the first major book of American poetry. Nevertheless, over five years, it earned Bryant only $14.92. Gioia, Dana. "Longfellow in the Aftermath of Modernism". The Columbia History of American Poetry, edited by Jay Parini.

ISBN 0-231-07836-6 Poet and literary critic Thomas Holley Chivers, who often accused other writers of stealing poems, said that the only thing Bryant "ever wrote that may be called Poetry is 'Thanatopsis,' which he stole line for line from the Spanish."
