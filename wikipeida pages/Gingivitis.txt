[[Gingivitis]]

Gingivitis ("inflammation of the gum tissue") is a non-destructive periodontal disease. The American Academy of Periodontology. Proceedings of the World Workshop in Clinical Periodontics. Chicago:The American Academy of Periodontology; 1989:I/23-I/24. The most common form of gingivitis, and the most common form of periodontal disease overall, is in response to bacterial biofilms (also called plaque) adherent to tooth surfaces, termed plaque-induced gingivitis. In the absence of treatment, gingivitis may progress to periodontitis, which is a destructive form of periodontal disease. 

While in some sites or individuals gingivitis never progresses to periodontitis, data indicates that periodontitis is always preceded by gingivitis. 

==Classification==
As defined by the 1999 World Workshop in Clinical Periodontics, there are two primary categories of gingival diseases, each with numerous subgroups: 
# Dental plaque-induced gingival diseases.
## Gingivitis associated with plaque only
## Gingival diseases modified by systemic factors
## Gingival diseases modified by medications
## Gingival diseases modified by malnutrition
# Non-plaque-induced gingival lesions
## Gingival diseases of specific bacterial origin
## Gingival diseases of viral origin
## Gingival diseases of fungal origin
## Gingival diseases of genetic origin
## Gingival manifestations of systemic conditions
## Traumatic lesions
## Foreign body reactions
## Not otherwise specified

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of gingivitis are somewhat non-specific and manifest in the gum tissue as the classic signs of inflammation:
*Swollen gums
*Bright red or purple gums
*Gums that are tender or painful to the touch
*Bleeding gums or bleeding after brushing and/or flossing
*Bad breath (halitosis)

Additionally, the stippling that normally exists on the gum tissue of some individuals will often disappear and the gums may appear shiny when the gum tissue becomes swollen and stretched over the inflamed underlying connective tissue. The accumulation may also emit an unpleasant odor. When the gingiva are swollen, the epithelial lining of the gingival crevice becomes ulcerated and the gums will bleed more easily with even gentle brushing, and especially when flossing.
RISK FACTORS:

Risk factors associated with gingivitis are

•.These include:
• increase in age
• low socio-economic status
• poor education
• low dental care utilization
• poor oral hygiene levels
• smoking
• psychosocial stress and genetic factors
• pre-existing conditions (18)
The influence of pre-existing conditions such as diabetes on oral health has been well studied. The prevalence of gingivitis and periodontitis is higher, in patients with diabetes, compared to those without diabetes. Furthermore the symptoms are also more severe. Diabetes related factors such as increased fasting blood glucose, increased HbA1c, and decreased compliance to self-management of diabetes are all associated with increasing prevalence of gingivitis and worsening periodontal health. 
 (19)

These factors were found to increase the risk for gingivitis and subsequently periodontitis in two not affiliated studies recently. Adjacent studies conducted in the United States 1988 – 1996 have shown that risk factors are similar despite geographical locations aiding in validating the results of these studies

==Cause==

The etiology, or cause, of plaque-induced gingivitis is bacterial plaque, which acts to initiate the body's host response. This, in turn, can lead to destruction of the gingival tissues, which may progress to destruction of the periodontal attachment apparatus. The plaque accumulates in the small gaps between teeth, in the gingival grooves and in areas known as plaque traps: locations that serve to accumulate and maintain plaque. Examples of plaque traps include bulky and overhanging restorative margins, claps of removable partial dentures and calculus (tartar) that forms on teeth. Although these accumulations may be tiny, the bacteria in them produce chemicals, such as degrative enzymes, and toxins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS, otherwise known as endotoxin) or lipoteichoic acid (LTA), that promote an inflammatory response in the gum tissue. This inflammation can cause an enlargement of the gingiva and subsequent formation.

==Diagnosis==
Each tooth is divided into four gingival units (mesial, distal, buccal, and lingual) and given a score from 0-3 based on the gingival index. The four scores are then averaged to give each tooth a single score. (21)
Gingivitis is a category of periodontal disease where there is no loss of bone but there is presence of inflammation and bleeding.

The diagnosis of the periodontal disease Gingivitis is done by a dentist. The diagnosis is based on clinical assessment data acquired during a comprehensive periodontal exam. Either a registered dental hygienist or a dentist may perform the comprehensive periodontal exam but the data interpretation and diagnosis is done by the dentist. The comprehensive periodontal exam consists of a visual exam, a series of radiographs, probing of the gingiva, determine the extent of current or past damage to the periodontium and a comprehensive review of the medical and dental histories.

Current research shows that activity levels of the following enzymes in saliva samples are associated with periodontal destruction: asparatate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and acid phosphatase (ACP). Therefore these enzyme biomarkers may be used to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis

A dental hygienist or dentist will check for the symptoms of gingivitis, and may also examine the amount of plaque in the oral cavity. A dental hygienist or dentist will also look for signs of periodontitis using X-rays or periodontal probing as well as other methods.

If gingivitis is not responsive to treatment, referral to a periodontist (a specialist in diseases of the gingiva and bone around teeth and dental implants) for further treatment may be necessary.

==Prevention==
Gingivitis can be prevented through regular oral hygiene that includes daily brushing and flossing. Hydrogen peroxide, saline, alcohol or chlorhexidine mouth washes may also be employed. In a recent clinical study, the beneficial effect of hydrogen peroxide on gingivitis has been highlighted. 
Rigorous plaque control programs along with periodontal scaling and curettage also have proved to be helpful, although according to the American Dental Association, periodontal scaling and root planing are considered as a treatment to periodontal disease, not as a preventive treatment for periodontal disease. American Dental Hygienists’ Association Position Paper on the Oral Prophylaxis, Approved by the ADHA Board of Trustees April 29, 1998 In a 1997 review of effectiveness data the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found clear evidence which showed that toothpaste containing triclosan was effective in preventing gingivitis.

In many countries, such as the United States, mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine are available only by prescription.

Researchers analyzed government data on calcium consumption and periodontal disease indicators in nearly 13,000 U.S. adults. They found that men and women who had calcium intakes of fewer than 500 milligrams, or about half the recommended dietary allowance, were almost twice as likely to have gum disease, as measured by the loss of attachment of the gums from the teeth. The association was particularly evident for people in their 20s and 30s. Calcium Reduces Risk for Gum Disease. Perio.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-30. 

Preventing gum disease may also benefit a healthy heart. According to physicians with The Institute for Good Medicine at the Pennsylvania Medical Society, good oral health can reduce risk of cardiac events. Poor oral health can lead to infections that can travel within the bloodstream. Good Oral Health Can Help Your Heart, Institute for Good Medicine at the Pennsylvania Medical Society, 2009. 

==Treatment==

The focus of treatment for gingivitis is removal of the etiologic (causative) agent, plaque. Therapy is aimed at the reduction of oral bacteria, and may take the form of regular periodic visits to a dental professional together with adequate oral hygiene home care. Thus, several of the methods used in the prevention of gingivitis can also be used for the treatment of manifest gingivitis, such as scaling, root planing, curettage, mouth washes containing chlorhexidine or hydrogen peroxide, and flossing. Interdental brushes also help remove any causative agents. 

Recent scientific studies have also shown the beneficial effects of mouthwashes with essential oils. 

Furthermore, oral Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) rinses are a relatively new treatment modality for treating inflammation in the oral cavity. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or diclofenac, are a mainstay of analgesic and anti-inflammatory treatment in dentistry. However, the systemic use of NSAID's are associated with ulcerogenic effects and several other side-effects, namely gastric irritability, fluid-retention and nephrotoxicity; among these gastric irritability is most common. Therefore, it is preferable to use local formulations such as mouthwashes to treat oral inflammatory conditions e.g. gingivitis. A randomized, investigator-blind, clinical study published in September, 2011, showed the new Diclofenac Epolamine (diclofenac N-(2-hydroxyethyl) Pyrrolidine; DHEP), a diclofenac salt with greater water solubility, as an effective and tolerable medicinal product for symptomatic and post-surgical relief of inflammation of the oral cavity. http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/adis/cdi/2012/00000032/00000001/art00004 Volunteers with inflammatory conditions, of which gingivitis was most prevalent, treated with DHEP, experienced a significantly greater reduction in pain and inflammation and were also free of pain and inflammatory symptoms as soon as Day 3 of the study compared to those treated with merely 0.0075% diclofenac mouthwash. There was an even greater reduction relative to the placebo group. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20930354 

Moreover, studies published in the Journal of Periodontology comparing the NSAID’s, Celcoxib or Etorcoxib and the corticosteroid, dexamethasone also showed the power and efficacy of using proper NSAID therapy to combat oral inflammation. The results of these studies showed the use of celecoxib or dexamethasone as effective for the prevention and preemptive control of postoperative pain after periodontal surgery. Another affective treatment option for people with gingivitis is full mouth ultrasonic debridement. It helps with plaque/bleeding on probing, pocket depth, relative recession, and relative probing attachment level at baseline. The level of effectiveness varies from smokers and non-smokers, however. Smokers experienced less effective results overall, despite using a non-surgical technique. (20)

Overall, Intensive oral hygiene care has been shown to dramatically improves gingival health in individuals with well-controlled type 2 diabetes. Periodontal destruction is also slowed down due to the extensive oral care. Intensive oral hygiene care (oral health education plus supra-gingival scaling) without any periodontal therapy improves gingival health, and may prevent progression of gingivitis in well-controlled diabetes (17)
