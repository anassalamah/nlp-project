[[Rub' al Khali]]

The Rubʿ al Khali ( , Other standardized transliterations include: / . The is the assimilated Arabic definitive article, , which can also be transliterated as . “the empty quarter”) or Empty Quarter is the largest sand desert in the world, encompassing most of the southern third of the Arabian Peninsula, including Saudi Arabia and areas of Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. The desert covers some 650000 km2 (the area between long. 44°30′ −56°30′E., and lat. 16°30′ −23°00′N). It is part of the larger Arabian Desert.

==Description==
 Typical pale gravel plains surrounded by huge sand dunes.
 Water found just 3 meters deep from ground level.

===Terrain===
The desert is 1000 km long, and 500 km wide. Its surface elevation varies from 800 m in the southwest to around sea level in the northeast. The terrain is covered with sand dunes with heights up to 250 m, interspersed with gravel and gypsum plains. The sand is a reddish-orange color due to the presence of feldspar. 

There are also brackish salt flats in some areas, such as the Umm al Samim area on the desert's eastern edge. 

====Lake beds====
Along the middle length of the desert there are a number of raised, hardened areas of calcium carbonate, gypsum, marl, or clay that were once the site of shallow lakes. These lakes existed during periods from 6,000 to 5,000 years ago and 3,000 to 2,000 years ago. The lakes are thought to have formed as a result of “cataclysmic rainfall” similar to present-day monsoon rains and most probably lasted for only a few years. However, lakes in the Mundafen area in the southwest of the Rubʿ al Khali show evidence of lasting longer, up to 800 years, due to increased runoff from the Tuwaiq Escarpment. 

Evidence suggests that the lakes were home to a variety of flora and fauna. Fossil remains indicate the presence of several animal species, such as hippopotamus, water buffalo, and long-horned cattle. The lakes also contained small snails, ostracods, and when conditions were suitable, freshwater clams. Deposits of calcium carbonate and opal phytoliths indicate the presence of plants and algae. There is also evidence of human activity dating from 3,000 to 2,000 years ago, including chipped flint tools, but no actual human remains have been found. 

===Climate===
The region is classified as "hyper-arid", with typical annual rainfall of less than 30 mm. Daily maximum temperatures average at 47 C and can reach as high as 56 C. 

===Biodiversity===
Fauna includes arachnids (e.g. scorpions) and rodents, while plants live throughout the Empty Quarter. As an ecoregion, the Rubʿ al Khali falls within the Arabian Desert and East Saharo-Arabian xeric shrublands. 

===Oil===
Geologically, the Empty Quarter is the most oil-rich site in the world. Vast oil reserves have been discovered underneath the sand dunes. Sheyba, at the northeastern edge of the Rubʿ al Khali, is a major light crude oil-producing site in Saudi Arabia. Ghawar, the largest oil field in the world, extends southward into the northernmost parts of the Empty Quarter.

==History==

Desertification has increased through the millennia. Before desertification made the caravan trails leading across the Rubʿ al Khali so difficult, the caravans of the frankincense trade crossed now virtually impassable stretches of wasteland, until about AD 300. It has been suggested that Ubar or Iram, a lost city, depended on such trade. The traces of camel tracks, unidentifable on the ground, appear in satellite images. More recently, tribal populations were also present in certain parts of the Empty Quarter, with the largest in the Najran region. A few road links were connected with these tribal settlements to the water resource and oil production centers.

===Expeditions===
The first documented journeys by non-resident explorers were made by British explorers Bertram Thomas in 1931 and St. John Philby in 1932. Between 1946 and 1950 Wilfred Thesiger crossed the area several times and mapped large parts including the mountains of Oman.

In June 1950, a US Air Force expedition crossed the Rubʿ al Khali from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, to central Yemen and back http://www.zianet.com/tmorris/june1950expedition-1.jpg in trucks to collect specimens for the Smithsonian Institution and to test desert survival procedures. 

In 1999 Jamie Clarke became the first Westerner to cross the Empty Quarter of Arabia in fifty years. His team of six, including three Bedouin, spent 40 days crossing the desert with a caravan of 13 camels. Everest to Arabia. Clarke J. Azimuth Inc. 2000 

On 25 February 2006, a scientific excursion organized by the Saudi Geological Survey began to explore the Empty Quarter. The expedition consisted of 89 environmentalists, geologists and scientists from Saudi Arabia and abroad. Various types of fossilized creatures as well as meteorites were discovered in the desert. The expedition discovered 31 new plant species and plant varieties, as well as 24 species of birds that inhabit the region, which fascinated scientists as to how they have survived under the harsh conditions of the Empty Quarter. 

In 2012, Alastair Humphreys and Leon McCarron pulled a specially designed cart from Salalah to Dubai. http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/in-the-footsteps-of-thesiger-two-britons-on-a-hotter-unexpected-desert-adventure#full They produced a documentary film about their journey and how it compared to those of Wilfred Thesiger http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/intotheemptyquarter 

On 4 February 2013, a South African team including Alex Harris, Marco Broccardo and David Joyce claimed that they became the first people to cross the Empty Quarter unsupported and on foot, in a journey which started in Salalah and lasted 40 days, eventually ending in Dubai. But about their route, there is possibility of controversy. The team only made use of three water stops along the journey, and pulled a specially designed cart which housed all the supplies necessary for the entire expedition. empty quarter expedition website 

In 2013, from 18 February to 28 March. Korean adventurer Young-Ho Nam, led a team on a crossing through the Empty Quarter on foot from Salalah, Oman, to Liwa, United Arab Emirates. The crossing was performed with permission from the government of Oman and U.A.E. Dewan Ruler's Representative for Western Region, Emirate of Abu Dhabi recognized it as the world's first on-foot crossing of the Empty Quarter. http://www.explorersweb.com/world/news.php?id=21490
