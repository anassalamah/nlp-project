[[Lillian Hellman]]

Lillian Florence "Lilly" Hellman (June 20, 1905 – June 30, 1984) was an American dramatist and screenwriter famously blacklisted by the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) at the height of the anti-communist campaigns of 1947-52.

Hellman was praised for sacrificing her career by refusing to answer questions by HUAC; but her denial that she had ever belonged to the Communist Party was easily disproved, and her veracity was doubted by many, including war correspondent Martha Gellhorn and literary critic Mary McCarthy.

She adapted her semi-autobiographical play The Little Foxes into a screenplay which received an Academy Award nomination in 1942.

Hellman was romantically involved with fellow left-wing writer Dashiell Hammett for thirty years until his death.

==Biography==

===Early life and marriage===
Lillian Hellman was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a Jewish family. Her mother was Julia Newhouse of Demopolis, Alabama, and her father was Max Hellman, a New Orleans shoe salesman. Julia Newhouse's parents were Sophie Marx, of a successful banking family, and Leonard Newhouse, a Demopolis liquor dealer. During most of her childhood she spent half of each year in New Orleans, in a boarding home run by her aunts, and the other half in New York City. She studied for two years at New York University and then took several courses at Columbia University. Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 37, 43, 47 

On December 31, 1925, Hellman married Arthur Kober, a playwright and press agent, although they often lived apart. Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 44-6 In 1929, she traveled around Europe for a time and settled in Bonn to continue her education. She felt an initial attraction to a Nazi student group that advocated "a kind of socialism" until their questioning about her Jewish ties made their antisemitism clear, and she returned immediately to the United States. Wright, Lillian Hellman, 52-3; Rollyson, Lillian Hellman, 36; Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 57-8. Hellman learned German from her family during childhood; Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 53 Years later she wrote, "Then for the first time in my life I thought about being a Jew." Wright, Lillian Hellman, 53, quoting Hellman, Scoundrel Time (1976) 

===Career and politics, 1930s===
Beginning in 1930, for about a year she earned $50 a week as a reader for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in Hollywood, writing summaries of novels and periodical literature for potential screenplays. Dick, Hollywood, 19–21 While there she met and fell in love with mystery writer Dashiell Hammett. She divorced Kober and returned to New York City in 1932. Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 89–90 When she met Hammett in a Hollywood restaurant, she was 24 and he was 36. They maintained their relationship off and on until his death in January 1961. Lillian Hellman, "Introduction", in Dashiell Hammett, The Big Knockover (1972), vii

Hellman's drama The Children's Hour premiered on Broadway on November 24, 1934, and ran for 691 performances. Dick, Hollywood, 32 It depicts a false accusation of lesbianism by a schoolgirl against two of her teachers. The falsehood is discovered, but before amends can be made one teacher is rejected by her fiancé and the other commits suicide. Dick, Hollywood, 32-3 Following the success of The Children's Hour, Hellman returned to Hollywood as a screenwriter for Goldwyn Pictures at $2500 a week. Dick, Hollywood, 21 She first collaborated on a screenplay for The Dark Angel, an earlier play and silent film. Dick, Hollywood, 21–29 Following that film's successful release in 1935, Goldwyn purchased the rights to The Children's Hour for $35,000 while it still was running on Broadway. Dick, Hollywood, 30-1 Hellman rewrote the play to conform to the standards of the Motion Picture Production Code, under which any mention of lesbianism was impossible. Instead, one schoolteacher is accused of having sex with the other's fiancé. Dick, Hollywood, 35-6ff. It appeared in 1936 under the title, These Three. She next wrote the screenplay for Dead End, which featured the first appearance of the Dead End Kids and premiered in 1937. Dick, Hollywood, 50ff. 

In 1935, Hellman joined the struggling Screen Writers Guild, devoted herself to recruiting new members, and proved one of its most aggressive advocates. Wright, Lillian Hellman, 116-8 One of its key issues was the dictatorial way producers credited writers for their work, known as "screen credit". Hellman had received no recognition for some of her earlier projects, although she was the principal author of The Westerner (1934) and a principal contributor to The Melody Lingers On (1935). Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 126-7; Internet Movie Database: "The Westerner (1934)", accessed December 29, 2011; Internet Movie Database: "The Melody Lingers On (1935)", accessed December 29, 2011 

In December 1936, her play Days to Come closed its Broadway run after just seven performances. Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 116, 118–20 In it, she portrayed a labor dispute in a small Ohio town during which the characters try to balance the competing claims of owners and workers, both represented as valid. Communist publications denounced her failure to take sides. Newman, Cold War Romance, 5 That same month she joined several other literary figures, including Dorothy Parker and Archibald MacLeish, in forming and funding a company, Contemporary Historians, Inc., to back a film project, The Spanish Earth, to demonstrate support for the anti-Franco forces in the Spanish Civil War. Rollyson, Lillian Hellman, 106; Wright, Lillian Hellman, 136; Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 120 

In March 1937, Hellman joined a group of 88 U.S. public figures in signing "An Open Letter to American Liberals" that protested an effort headed by John Dewey to examine Leon Trotsky's defense against his 1936 condemnation by the Soviet Union. The letter has been viewed by some critics as a defense of Stalin's Moscow Purge Trials. Richard Gid Powers, Not Without Honor: The History of American Anticommunism (Free Press, 1995), 143 It charged some of Trotsky's defenders with aiming to destabilize the Soviet Union and said that the Soviet Union "should be left to protect itself against treasonable plots as it saw fit." It asked U.S. liberals and progressives to unite with the Soviet Union against the growing fascist threat and avoid an investigation that would only fuel "the reactionary sections of the press and public" in the United States. Endorsing this view, the editors of the New Republic wrote that "there are more important questions than Trotsky's guilt". Those who signed the "Open Letter" called for a united front against fascism, that in their view required uncritical support of the Soviet Union. Spitzer, Historical Truth, 18–19. Hundreds added their names to the "Open Letter." Among the initial signers were Heywood Broun, Theodore Dreiser, Ring Lardner, Lillian Wald, Rockwell Kent, Dorothy Parker, Malcolm Cowley, and Nathaniel West. See Ackerman, Just Words, 184-5; Alan M. Wald, The New York Intellectuals: The Rise and Decline of the Anti-Stalinist Left from the 1930s to the 1980s (University of North Carolina Press, 1987), 132 Newman, Cold War Romance, 9–10 

In October 1937, Hellman spent a few weeks in Spain to lend her support, as other writers had, to the International Brigades of non-Spaniards who had joined the anti-Franco side in the Spanish Civil War. As bombs fell on Madrid, she broadcast a report to the U.S. on Madrid Radio. In 1989, journalist and Ernest Hemingway's third wife, Martha Gellhorn, herself in Spain at that period, disputed the account of this trip in Hellman's memoirs and claimed that Hellman waited until all witnesses were dead before describing events that never occurred. Nevertheless, Hellman had documented her trip in the New Republic in April 1938 as "A Day in Spain." Langston Hughes wrote admiringly of the radio broadcast in 1956. Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 131-3, 352–3, includes Hughes' report of the radio broadcast and Hellman's comments the next day citing his I Wonder as I Wander: An Autobiographical Journey, first published in 1956. Hellman's reportage was also reprinted in an anthology of journalism, This is my Best (1942); Griffin and Thorsten, Understanding, 104 

Hellman was a member of the Communist Party from 1938 to 1940, by her own account written in 1952, "a most casual member. I attended very few meetings and saw and heard nothing more than people sitting around a room talking of current events or discussing the books they had read. I drifted away from the Communist Party because I seemed to be in the wrong place. My own maverick nature was no more suitable to the political left than it had been to the conservative background from which I came." Haynes, 412 

Her play The Little Foxes opened on Broadway on February 13, 1939, and ran for 410 performances.

===Career and politics, 1940s===
On January 9, 1940, viewing the spread of fascism in Europe and fearing similar political developments in the United States, she said at a luncheon of the American Booksellers Association: Wright, Hellman, 168; New York Times: "Lin Yutang Holds 'Gods' Favor China," January 10, 1940, accessed December 16, 2011 

Her play Watch on the Rhine opened on Broadway on April 1, 1941, and ran for 378 performances. It won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award. She wrote the play in 1940, when its call for a united international alliance against Hitler directly contradicted the Communist position at the time, following the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of August 1939. Newman, Cold War Romance, 11–12 Early in 1942, Hellman accompanied the production to Washington, D.C., for a benefit performance where she spoke with President Roosevelt. Martinson, 'Hellman, 171-2 Hammett wrote the screenplay for the movie version that appeared in 1943.

In October 1941, Hellman and Ernest Hemingway co-hosted a dinner to raise money for anti-Nazi activists imprisoned in France. New York Governor Herbert Lehman agreed to participate, but withdrew because some of the sponsoring organizations, he wrote, "have long been connected with Communist activities." Hellman replied: "I do not and I did not ask the politics of any members of the committee and there is nobody who can with honesty vouch for anybody but themselves." New York Times: "Governor to Shun 'Communist' Forum," October 4, 1941, accessed December 19, 2011 She assured him the funds raised would be used as promised and later provided him with a detailed accounting. Rollyson, 184-5 The next month she wrote him: "I am sure it will make you sad and ashamed as it did me to know that, of the seven resignations out of 147 sponsors, five were Jews. Of all the peoples in the world, I think, we should be the last to hold back help, on any grounds, from those who fought for us." Martinson, 141

In 1942, Hellman received an Academy Award nomination for her screenplay for the film version of The Little Foxes. Dick, Hollywood, 58ff. Two years later, she received another nomination for her screenplay Dick, Hollywood, 99ff. for The North Star, Academy Awards Database: "Lillian Hellman", accessed December 10, 2011 the only original screenplay of her career. Brett Westbrook, "Fighting for What's Good: Strategies of Propaganda in Lillian Hellman's 'Negro Picture' and 'The North Star'", Film History, Vol. 4, No. 2, 1990, 166 She objected to the film's production numbers that, she said, turned a village festival into "an extended opera bouffe peopled by musical comedy characters," but still told the New York Times that it was "a valuable and true picture which tells a good deal of the truth about fascism." To establish the difference between her screenplay and the film, Hellman published her screenplay in the fall of 1943. Dick, Hollywood, 101ff., quotes 103; Newman, Cold War Romance, 13. British historian Robert Conquest wrote that "a travesty greater than could have been shown on Soviet screens to audiences used to lies, but experienced in collective-farm conditions". 

In April 1944, Hellman's The Searching Wind opened on Broadway. New York Times: Lewis Nichols, "'The Searching Wind'; Lillian Hellman's Latest Play a Study of Appeasement and Love," April 23, 1944, accessed December 11, 2011 Her third World War II project, it tells the story of an ambassador whose indecisive relations with his wife and mistress mirror the vacillation and appeasement of his professional life. Dick, Hollywood, 108-9 She wrote the screenplay for the film version that appeared two years later. Dick, Hollywood, 108ff. Both versions depicted the ambassador's feckless response to anti-Semitism. Dick, Hollywood, 114-6 The conservative press noted that the play reflected none of Hellman's pro-Soviet views, and the communist response to the play was negative. Newman, Cold War Romance, 13-4 

Hellman's applications for a passport to travel to England in April 1943 and May 1944 were both denied because government authorities considered her "an active Communist," though in 1944 the head of the Passport Division of the Department of State, Ruth Shipley, cited "the present military situation" as the reason. Newman, Cold War Romance, 1 In August 1944, she received a passport, indicative of government approval, for travel to Russia on a goodwill mission as a guest of VOKS, the Soviet agency that handled cultural exchanges. Newman, Cold War Romance, 1–2, 14–17 During her visit from November 5, 1944, to January 18, 1945, she began an affair with John F. Melby, a foreign service officer, that continued as an intermittent affair for years and as a friendship for the rest of her life. Newman, Cold War Romance, 33–40 

In May 1946, the National Institute of Arts and Letters made Hellman a member. New York Times: "Fulbright Warns of Soviet Attitude," May 18, 1946, accessed December 19, 2011 In November of that year, her play Another Part of the Forest premiered, directed by Hellman. It presented the same characters twenty years younger than they had appeared in The Little Foxes. A film version to which Hellman did not contribute followed in 1948. Dick, Hollywood, 64, 71–3 

In 1947, Columbia Pictures offered Hellman a multi-year contract, which she refused because the contract included a loyalty clause that she viewed as an infringement on her rights of free speech and association. It required her to sign a statement that she had never been a member of the Communist Party and would not associate with radicals or subversives, which would have required her to end her life with Hammett. Shortly thereafter, William Wyler told her he was unable to hire her to work on a film because she was blacklisted. Dick, Hollywood, 119. Wyler is quoted in a transcript of a 1977 television broadcast in Bryer, Conversations, 211-2 

In November 1947, the leaders of the motion picture industry decided to deny employment to anyone who refused to answer questions posed by the House Un-American Activities Committee. Following the Hollywood Ten's defiance of the committee, Hellman wrote an editorial in the December issue of Screen Writer, the publication of the Screen Writers Guild. Titled "The Judas Goats," it mocked the committee and derided the producers for allowing themselves to be intimidated. It said in part: Wright, Lillian Hellman, 212-4 

Melby and Hellman corresponded regularly in the years following World War II while he held State Department assignments overseas. Their political views diverged as he came to advocate containment of communism while she was unwilling to hear criticism of the Soviet Union. They became, in one historian's view, "political strangers, occasional lovers, and mostly friends." Bernard F. Dick, "Review of Newman Cold War Romance," Journal of American History, vol. 77, no. 1, June 1990, 354–5. Melby particularly objected to her support for Henry Wallace in the 1948 presidential election. Newman, Cold War Romance, 121-3 

In 1949 she adapted Emmanuel Roblès' French-language play, Montserrat, for Broadway, where it opened on October 29. Again, Hellman directed it. Dick, Hollywood, 108. It was revived in 1954; New York Times: "Lillian Hellman Drama at Barbizon-Plaza," May 26, 1954, accessed December 11, 2011. It was revived again in 1961; New York Times: "Lillian Hellman Play Revived at the Gate," January 9, 1961, accessed December 11, 2011 

===Career and politics, 1950s===
The play that is recognized by critics and judged by Hellman as her best, Bryer, Conversations, 175 (interview 1975) The Autumn Garden, premiered in 1951.

In 1952 Hellman was called to testify before HUAC, which had heard testimony that she had attended Communist Party meetings in 1937. She initially drafted a statement that said her two-year membership in the Communist Party had ended in 1940, but she did not condemn the party nor express regret for her participation in it. Her attorney, Joseph Rauh, opposed her admission of membership on technical grounds because she had attended meetings, but never formally become a party member. He warned that the committee and the public would expect her to take a strong anti-communist stand to atone for her political past, but she refused to apologize or denounce the party. Faced with Hellman's position, Rauh devised a strategy that produced favorable press coverage and allowed her to avoid the stigma of being labeled a "Fifth Amendment Communist". On May 19, 1952, Hellman authored a letter to HUAC that one historian has described as "written not to persuade the Committee, but to shape press coverage." Haynes, 410 In it she explained her willingness to testify only about herself and that she did not want to claim her rights under the Fifth Amendment–"I am ready and willing to testify before the representatives of our Government as to my own actions, regardless of any risks or consequences to myself." She wrote that she found the legal requirement that she testify about others if she wanted to speak about her own actions "difficult for a layman to understand." Rauh had the letter delivered to the HUAC's chairman Rep. John S. Wood on Monday. 

In public testimony before HUAC on Tuesday, May 21, 1952, Hellman answered preliminary questions about her background. When asked about attending a specific meeting at the home of Hollywood screenwriter Martin Berkeley, she refused to respond, claiming her rights under the Fifth Amendment and she referred the committee to her letter by way of explanation. The Committee responded that it had considered and rejected her request to be allowed to testify only about herself and entered her letter into the record. Hellman answered only one additional question: she denied she had ever belonged to the Communist Party. She cited the Fifth Amendment in response to several more questions and the committee dismissed her. Historian John Earl Haynes credits both Rauh's "clever tactics" and Hellman's "sense of the dramatic" for what followed the conclusion of Hellman's testimony. As the committee moved on to other business, Rauh released to the press copies of her letter to HUAC. Committee members, unprepared for close questioning about Hellman's stance, offered only offhand comments. The press reported Hellman's statement at length, its language crafted to overshadow the comments of the HUAC members. She wrote in part: Haynes, 409-11; Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 258-65 

Reaction divided along political lines. Murray Kempton, a longtime critic of her sympathy for communist causes, praised her: "It is enough that she has reached into her conscience for an act based on something more than the material or the tactical...she has chosen to act like a lady." The FBI increased its surveillance of her travel and her mail. Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 265-7 

In the early 1950s, at the height of anti-communist fervor in the United States, the state department investigated whether Melby posed a security risk. In April 1952, the department stated its one formal charge against him: "that during the period 1945 to date, you have maintained an association with one, Lillian Hellman, reliably reported to be a member of the Communist Party," based on testimony from unidentified informants. When Melby appeared before the department's Loyalty Security Board, he was not allowed to contest Hellman's Communist Party affiliation or learn who informed against her, but only to present his understanding of her politics and the nature of his relationship with her, including the occasional renewal of their physical relationship. He said he had no plans to renew their friendship, but never promised to avoid contact with her. Newman, Cold War Romance, 164ff., includes lengthy excerpts from testimony. In the course of a series of appeals, Hellman testified before the Loyalty Security Board on his behalf. She offered to answer questions about her political views and associations, but the board only allowed her to describe her relationship with Melby. She testified that she had many longstanding friendships with people of different political views and that political sympathy was not a part of those relationships. She described how her relationship with Melby changed over time and how their sexual relationship was briefly renewed in 1950 after a long hiatus: "The relationship obviously at this point was neither one thing nor the other: it was neither over nor was it not over." Newman, Cold War Romance, esp. 233-52, quote 242 She said that: Newman, Cold War Romance, 245 

The State Department dismissed Melby on April 22, 1953. As was its practice, the board gave no reason for its decision. Newman, Cold War Romance, 261 

In 1954, Hellman declined when asked to adapt Anne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl (1952) for the stage. According to writer and director Garson Kanin, she said that the diary was "a great historical work which will probably live forever, but I couldn't be more wrong as the adapter. If I did this it would run one night because it would be deeply depressing. You need someone who has a much lighter touch." She recommended her friends, Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett. David L. Goodrich, The Real Nick and Nora: Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, Writers of Stage and Screen Classics (Southern Illinois University Press, 2001), 206. For the controversy about the resulting play's failure to emphasize Anne Frank's Jewishness, see Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 280-1; Rollyson, Lillian Hellman, 482-5 

Hellman made an English-language adaption of Jean Anouilh's play, L'Alouette, based on the trial of Joan of Arc, called The Lark. Leonard Bernstein composed incidental music for the first production, which opened on Broadway on November 17, 1955. Atkinson compared Hellman's work favorably to the staging of Christopher Fry's translation seen in London in the spring of 1955. Hellman edited a collection of Chekhov's correspondence that appeared in 1955 as The Selected Letters of Anton Chekhov. New York Times: Frank O'Connor, Book Review, April 24, 1955, accessed December 16, 2011 

Following the success of The Lark, Hellman conceived of another play with incidental music, based on Voltaire's Candide. Bernstein convinced her to develop it as a comic operetta with a much more substantial musical component. She wrote the spoken dialogue, which many others then worked on, and wrote some lyrics as well for what became the often-revived, Candide. Joan Peyser, Bernstein: A Biography, (NY: Beech Tree Books, 1987), 248 Hellman hated the collaboration and revisions on deadline that Candide required: "I went to pieces when something had to be done quickly, because someone didn't like something, and there was no proper time to think it out...I realized that I panicked under conditions I wasn't accustomed to." Bryer, Conversations, 130 (interview 1970), 148 (interview 1974) 

===Career and politics, 1960s===
Her play Toys in the Attic opened on Broadway on February 25, 1960, and ran for 464 performances. It received a Tony Award nomination for Best Play. In this family drama set in New Orleans, money, marital infidelity, and revenge end in a woman's disfigurement. Dick, Hollywood, 120-1 Hellman had no hand in the screenplay, which altered the drama's tone and exaggerated the characterizations, and the resulting film received bad reviews. Dick, Hollywood, 121-4

A second film version of The Children's Hour, less successful both with critics and at the box office, appeared in 1961 under that title, but Hellman played no role in the screenplay, having withdrawn from the project following Hammett's death in 1961. Dick, Hollywood, 35, 43ff. In 1961, Brandeis University awarded her its Creative Arts Medal for outstanding lifetime achievement and the women's division of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University gave her its Achievement Award. Rollyson, Lillian Hellman, 407 The following year, in December 1962, Hellman was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters Wright, Hellman, 289 and inducted at a May 1963 ceremony. New York Times: "Honors Bestowed by Arts Academy," May 23, 1963, accessed December 19, 2011 

Another play, My Mother, My Father, and Me, proved unsuccessful when it was staged in March 1963. It closed after 17 performances. Hellman adapted it from Burt Blechman's novel How Much? Dick, Hollywood, 125, 136, 167. It was revived in 1980. New York Times: Mel Gussow, "Stage: 'My Mother, My Father, and Me," January 10, 1980, accessed December 16, 2011 

Hellman wrote another screenplay in 1965 for The Chase starring Marlon Brando based on a play and novel by Horton Foote. Though Hellman received sole credit for the screenplay, she worked from an earlier treatment, and director Sam Spiegel made additional changes and altered the sequence of scenes. Dick, Hollywood, 125-35 In 1966, she edited a collection of Hammett's stories, The Big Knockover. Her introductory profile of Hammett was her first exercise in memoir writing. Dick, Hollywood, 136; Lillian Hellman, ed., The Big Knockover: Selected Stories and Short Novels (NY: Random House, 1966) 

Hellman wrote a reminiscence of gulag-survivor Lev Kopelev, husband of her translator in Russia during 1944, to serve as the introduction to his anti-Stalinist memoirs, To Be Preserved Forever, which appeared in 1976. Newman, Cold War Romance, 14; Lev Kopelev, To be Preserved Forever (NY: Lippincott, 1977); New York Times: Arthur Miller, "Un-Soviet Activity," July 31, 1977, accessed December 15, 2011; Austenfeld, American Women Writers, 106 In February 1980, she, John Hersey, and Norman Mailer wrote to Soviet authorities to protest retribution against Kopelev for his defense of Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov. New York Times: "U.S. Writers Protest to Brezhnev on Sakharov and Kopelev Cases," February 8, 1980, accessed December 15, 2011 

Hellman was a long-time friend of author Dorothy Parker and served as her literary executor after her death in 1967.

Hellman published her first volume of memoirs, An Unfinished Woman: A Memoir, in 1969. For it she won the U.S. National Book Award in category Arts and Letters. 
"National Book Awards – 1970". National Book Foundation. Retrieved March 10, 2012. "Arts and Letters" was an award category from 1964 to 1976. 

===Career and politics, 1970s===
In the early 1970s, Hellman taught writing for short periods at the University of California, Berkeley, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Hunter College in New York City. Wright Lillian Hellman, 334 

Her second volume of memoirs, (book)|Pentimento: A Book of Portraits], appeared in 1973. In an interview at the time, Hellman described the difficulty of writing about the 1950s: Bryer, Conversations, 134 (interview 1973), 250 (1979 interview) 

Hellman published her third volume of memoirs, Scoundrel Time, in 1976.

In 1976, Hellman posed in a fur coat for the Blackglama national advertising campaign "What Becomes a Legend Most?". Bryer, Conversations, 192, 216 In August of that year she was awarded the prestigious Edward MacDowell Medal for her contribution to literature. Wright, Lillian Hellman, 356 In October, she received the Paul Robeson Award from Actors' Equity. New York Times: "Notes on People," October 6, 1976, accessed December 19, 2011 

In 1976, Hellman's publisher, Little Brown, canceled its contract to publish a book of Diana Trilling's essays because Trilling refused to delete four passages critical of Hellman. New York Times: Robert D. McFadden, "Diana Trilling Book is Canceled; Reply to Lillian Hellman is Cited," September 28, 1976, accessed December 15, 2011. When Trilling's collection appeared in 1977, a sympathetic critic in the New York Times preferred the "simple confession of error" Hellman made in Scoundrel Time for her "acquiescence in Stalinism" to Trilling's excuses for her own behavior during the McCarthy period. New York Times: Thomas R. Edwards, "A Provocative Moral Voice," May 29, 1977, accessed December 16, 2011; Diana Trilling, We Must March My Darlings: A Critical Decade (NY: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1977) 

Hellman presented the Academy Award for Best Documentary Film at a ceremony on March 28, 1977. Greeted by a standing ovation, she said: Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 13 

The 1977 Oscar-winning film Julia was based on the "Julia" chapter of Pentimento. On June 30, 1976, as the film was going into production, Hellman wrote about the screenplay to its producer: Austenfeld, American Women Writers, 102-3 

In a 1979 television interview, author Mary McCarthy, long Hellman's political adversary and the object of her negative literary judgment, said of Hellman that "every word she writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the'." Hellman responded by filing a US$2,500,000 defamation suit against McCarthy, interviewer Dick Cavett, and PBS. Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 354–356 McCarthy in turn produced evidence she said proved that Hellman had lied in some accounts of her life. Cavett said he sympathized more with McCarthy than Hellman in the lawsuit, but "everybody lost" as a result of it. Norman Mailer attempted unsuccessfully to mediate the dispute through an open letter he published in the New York Times. New York Times: Norman Mailer, "An Appeal to Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy," May 11, 1980, accessed December 16, 2011 At the time of her death, Hellman was still in litigation with Mary McCarthy, and Hellman's executors dropped the suit.

===Last years===
In 1980, Hellman published a short novel, Maybe: A Story. Though presented as fiction, Hellman, Hammett, and other nonfictional people appeared as characters. It received a mixed reception and was sometimes read as another installment of Hellman's memoirs. New York Times: Anatole Broyard, ""Books of the Times," May 13, 19809, accessed December 11, 2011; New York Times: Robert Towers, "A Foray into the Self," June 1, 1980, accessed December 17, 2011; Wright 392 Hellman's editor wrote to the New York Times to question a reviewer's attempt to check the facts in the novel. He described it as a work of fiction whose characters misremember and dissemble. New York Times: William Abrahams, "Letters: Maybe Not," July 20, 1980, accessed December 17, 2011 One journalist wrote that it is "an examination of memory that comes as close as Hellman is likely to get to novel writing." Bryer, Conversations, 290 (1981 interview). Martinson counts it as Hellman's fourth memoir, but later comments of one passage: "Something she wrote in Maybe sounds more true than fictional."; Martinson, Lillian Hellman, 313, 332. See also Rollyson, Lillian Hellman, 529-31; Griffen and Thorsten, Understanding, 127ff. 

In 1983, New York psychiatrist Muriel Gardiner claimed that she was the basis for the title character in Julia and that she had never known Hellman. Hellman denied that the character was based on Gardiner. Because the events Hellman described matched Gardiner's account of her life and Gardiner's family was closely tied to Hellman's attorney, critics believe that Hellman appropriated Gardiner's story without attribution. New York Times: Edwin McDowell, "New Memoir Stirs 'Julia' Controversy," April 29, 1983, accessed December 16, 2011. The attorney was Wolf Schwabacher. 

Hellman died on June 30, 1984, at age 79 from a heart attack at her home on Martha's Vineyard. New York Times: "Lillian Hellman, Playwright, Author and Rebel, Dies at 79," July 1, 1984, accessed December 10, 2011
