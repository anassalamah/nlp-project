Please excuse me, I forgot to sign my question. I'm the one who wrote the following: I am trying to edit in the Sandbox to make a Wikipedia link to a Wikipedia article, which is The Tempest. I entered it like this, The Tempest, but it didn't convert to a link when I hit "Show Preview." Other links that I used worked fine. Can anyone please suggest what I did wrong? Thank you.209.244.188.148 (talk:209.244.188.148|talk]) 23:24, 21 December 2007 (UTC)
