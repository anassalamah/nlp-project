==Biography==

===Early life and family===
William Dean Howells was born on March 1, 1837, in Martinsville, Ohio (now known as Martins Ferry, Ohio), to William Cooper and Mary Dean Howells. Lynn, 35 He was the second of eight children. His father was a newspaper editor and printer, who moved frequently around Ohio. In 1840, the family settled in Hamilton, Ohio, Lynn, 36 where William Cooper Howells oversaw a Whig newspaper and followed Swedenborgianism; Olsen, 33–34 their nine years there marked the longest they would stay in one place. Though the family had to live frugally, the young Howells was encouraged by his parents in his literary interests. Olsen, 36 Howells began to help his father with typesetting and printing work at an early age, a job known at the time as a printer's devil. In 1852, his father arranged to have one of Howells' poems published in the Ohio State Journal without telling him.

===Early career===
In 1856, Howells was elected as a clerk in the State House of Representatives. In 1858 he began to work at the Ohio State Journal where he wrote poetry, short stories, and also translated pieces from French, Spanish, and German. He studied avidly German and other languages and was greatly interested in Heinrich Heine. In 1860 he visited Boston and met with other American writers James Thomas Fields, James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, and became a personal friend to many, including Henry Adams, William James, Henry James and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.. See, e.g., Smith, Harriet Elinor, edit., The Autobiography of Mark Twain, Volume 1, University of California Press, 2010, p.475. 

The William Dean Howells House in Cambridge, MA was designed by his wife Elinor Mead, and was occupied by Howells and his family from 1873 to 1878.Said to have been rewarded for an official biography 
William Dean Howells and John L. Hayes, The Lives and Speeches of Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin, Columbus, OH: Follett, Foster and Co, 1860 of Abraham Lincoln used during the election of 1860, he gained a consulship in Venice. On Christmas Eve 1862, at the American embassy in Paris, he married Elinor Mead, a sister of the sculptor Larkin Goldsmith Mead and the architect William Rutherford Mead, the Mead of McKim, Mead, and White. Among their children was the future architect John Mead Howells.

===Editorship and other literary pursuits===
Upon returning to America in 1865 and settling in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Howells wrote for various magazines, including the Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Magazine. In January 1866 James Fields offered him a position as assistant editor at the Atlantic Monthly, which Howells accepted after successfully negotiating for a higher salary, though he was frustrated by Fields's close supervision. Goodman and Dawson, 107–108 After five years, in 1871 Howells was made editor, and remained in this position until 1881. In 1869 he first met Mark Twain, which began a longtime friendship. But more important for the development of his literary style—his advocacy of Realism—was his relationship with the journalist Jonathan Baxter Harrison, who during the 1870s wrote a series of articles for the Atlantic Monthly on the lives of ordinary Americans (Fryckstedt 1958). Howells gave a series of twelve lectures on "Italian Poets of Our Century" for the Lowell Institute during its 1870-71 season. Harriet Knight Smith, The History of the Lowell Institute, Boston: Lamson, Wolffe and Co., 1898. 

He had published his first novel, Their Wedding Journey, in 1872, but his literary reputation soared with the realist novel A Modern Instance, published in 1882, which described the decay of a marriage. His 1885 novel The Rise of Silas Lapham became his best known, describing the rise and fall of an American entrepreneur of the paint business. His social views were also strongly represented in the novels Annie Kilburn (1888), A Hazard of New Fortunes (1890), and An Imperative Duty (1891). He was particularly outraged by the trials resulting from the Haymarket Riot, which led him to portray a similar riot in A Hazard of New Fortunes and to write publicly to protest the trials of the men allegedly involved in the Haymarket Affair. In his public writing and in his novels, he drew attention to pressing social issues of the time. He joined the Anti-Imperialist League in 1898, in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines.

His poems were collected in 1873 and 1886, and a volume under the title Stops of Various Quills was published in 1895. He was the initiator of the school of American realists who derived, through the Russians, from Balzac and had little sympathy with any other type of fiction, although he frequently encouraged new writers, such as Stephen Crane, Frank Norris, Hamlin Garland, Harold Frederic, Abraham Cahan, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Paul Laurence Dunbar, in whom he discovered new ideas or new fictional techniques.

===Later years===
In 1902, Howells published The Flight of Pony Baker, a book for children partly inspired by his own childhood. Olsen, 5 That same year, he bought a summer home overlooking the Piscataqua River in Kittery Point, Maine. William Dean Howells at Kittery He returned there annually until his death two decades later, when his son donated the property to Harvard University as a memorial. William Dean Howells Memorial House, Kittery Point, Maine In 1904 he was one of the first seven people chosen for membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters, of which he became president.

In February 1910, Elinor Howells began using morphine to treat her worsening neuritis. Goodman and Dawson, 401 She died on May 6, a few days after her birthday, and only two weeks after the death of Howells's friend Mark Twain. Henry James offered his condolences, writing, "I think of this laceration of your life with an infinite sense of all it will mean for you". Lynn, 322 Howells and his daughter Mildred decided to spend part of the year in their Cambridge home on Concord Avenue though, without Elinor, they found it "dreadful in its ghostliness and ghastliness". Goodman and Dawson, 402 

Howells died in his sleep shortly after midnight on May 11, 1920, Goodman and Dawson, 432 and was buried in Cambridge, Massachusetts. http://www.cambridgema.gov/theworks/ourservices/cambridgecemetery.aspx Eight years later his daughter published his correspondence as a biography of his literary life.

==Literary theory==
In addition to his own creative works, Howells also wrote criticism, and essays about contemporary literary figures such as Henrik Ibsen, Émile Zola, Giovanni Verga, Benito Pérez Galdós, and, especially, Leo Tolstoy, which helped establish their reputations in the United States. He also wrote critically in support of American writers Hamlin Garland, Stephen Crane, Emily Dickinson, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Sarah Orne Jewett, Charles W. Chesnutt, Abraham Cahan, Madison Cawein,and Frank Norris. It is perhaps in this role that he had his greatest influence. In his "Editor's Study" column at the Atlantic Monthly and, later, at Harper's, he formulated and disseminated his theories of "realism" in literature.

Howells viewed realism as "nothing more and nothing less than the truthful treatment of material." Crow, Charles L. A Companion to the Regional Literatures of America. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub., 2003: 92. ISBN 0631226311 In defense of the real, as opposed to the ideal, he wrote, "I hope the time is coming when not only the artist, but the common, average man, who always 'has the standard of the arts in his power,' will have also the courage to apply it, and will reject the ideal grasshopper wherever he finds it, in science, in literature, in art, because it is not 'simple, natural, and honest,' because it is not like a real grasshopper. But I will own that I think the time is yet far off, and that the people who have been brought up on the ideal grasshopper, the heroic grasshopper, the impassioned grasshopper, the self-devoted, adventureful, good old romantic card-board grasshopper, must die out before the simple, honest, and natural grasshopper can have a fair field." Criticism and Fiction," by William Dean Howells, accessed January 6, 2010. 

Howells believed the future of American writing was not in poetry but in novels, a form which he saw shifting from "romance" to a serious form. Ruland, Richard and Malcolm Bradbury.

Howells was a Christian socialist whose ideals were greatly influenced by Russian writer Leo Tolstoy. Ensign, Russell L. and Louis Patsouras.

Goodman and Dawson, 308 These influences led him to write on issues of social justice from a moral and egalitarian point of view, being critic of the social effects of industrial capitalism.

==Reception==
Noting the "documentary" and truthful value of Howells' work, Henry James wrote: "Stroke by stroke and book by book your work was to become, for this exquisite notation of our whole democratic light and shade and give and take, in the highest degree documentary."
