[[Santiago Calatrava]]

Santiago Calatrava Valls (, born 28 July 1951) is a Spanish architect, sculptor and structural engineer whose principal office is in Zürich, Switzerland. He has offices in Zürich, Paris and in New York City, where he now resides.

==Early life and education==
Calatrava was born in Benimàmet, an old municipality now integrated as an urban part of Valencia, Spain, where he took an undergraduate architecture degree at the Polytechnic University of Valencia. There he completed independent projects with fellow students, publishing two books on the vernacular architecture of Valencia and Ibiza. In 1975 he enrolled in the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, Switzerland for graduate work in civil engineering. In 1981, after completing his doctoral thesis, "On the Foldability of Space Frames", he started his architecture and engineering practice.

==Career==
The Milwaukee Art Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.

Calatrava's early career was largely dedicated to bridges and railway stations, with designs that elevated the status of civil engineering projects to new heights. His Montjuic Communications Tower in Barcelona, Spain (1991) in the heart of the 1992 Olympics site, as well as the Allen Lambert Galleria in Toronto, Canada (1992), were important works and turning points in his career, leading to a wide range of commissions. The Quadracci Pavilion (2001) of the Milwaukee Art Museum was his first building in the United States. Calatrava's entry into high-rise design began with an innovative 54-story-high twisting tower called Turning Torso (2005), located in Malmö, Sweden.

Calatrava has designed a neofuturistic train station, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, at the rebuilt World Trade Center in New York City. It is expected to open in 2015, six years behind schedule, at a cost of $4 billion, twice the original budget. 

In 2002 he was awarded the Sir Misha Black award and was added to the College of Medallists 

Calatrava has defined his style as bridging the division between structural engineering and architecture. In his projects, he claims to continue a tradition of Spanish modernist engineering that included Félix Candela, Antonio Gaudí, and Rafael Guastavino, with a very personal style that derives from numerous studies of the human body and the natural world. Architecture critics, however, see his work as a continuation of the expressionism of Eero Saarinen.

On 10 December 2011, he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture for a five year renewable term by Pope Benedict XVI. NOMINA DI MEMBRI DEL PONTIFICIO CONSIGLIO DELLA CULTURA 

In May 2012, Calatrava was accused of 'bleeding Valencia dry'. Calatrava has charged some €100m (£81m) to the Valencia government, according to the website, established by the leftwing Esquerra Unida i Alternativa party. The party says it has managed to see copies of bills paid by the People's party regional government to the architect, who is now based in Zurich and therefore out of the immediate reach of Spanish courts. 

In March 2013, a supreme Italian court started a procedure for a hearing against Calatrava and three engineers for overpricing a bridge in Venice. 

==Recent projects==
Allen Lambert Galleria at Brookfield Place, in Toronto, Canada 
Puente del Alamillo at night, made for the Expo 92, Seville, (1992)
Auditorio de Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain
Bahnhof Stadelhofen in Zürich

===Trinity River Bridges===
Calatrava's work includes three bridges that will eventually span the Trinity River in Dallas, Texas. The first bridge, the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge, named after donor Margaret Hunt Hill, was open for traffic in March 2012. If the remaining bridges are completed, Dallas will join the Dutch county of Haarlemmermeer in having three Calatrava bridges.

===Peace Bridge===
Calatrava's design for the Peace Bridge, a 130 m pedestrian bridge to span the Bow River in downtown Calgary, Alberta, Canada, was estimated to cost approximately $24.5 million. The project was approved by city council in early January 2009 and was scheduled for completion in fall 2010. Public disclosure of Peace Bridge plans was made on 28 July 2009, and it was described as a sleek, elegant contribution to downtown Calgary.

However, there was an uproar from Calgarians, since a bridge very similar to Calatrava's design was built in Toronto at a much lesser cost. The design model showed a sleek, tubular, single-span red-and-white trestle, offering separate pathways for cyclists and pedestrians. The bridge was expected to serve up to 5,000 pedestrians and cyclists daily. After considerable delays due to construction quality problems, the bridge opened in March 2012. 

===Florida Polytechnic University===
On 16 June 2009, it was announced that Calatrava would be designing the first building of the new University of South Florida Polytechnic campus in Lakeland, Florida. This will be his first work in the southeastern United States. The university is now Florida Polytechnic University scheduled to open in August 2014. , construction of the campus is well under way on Interstate 4 between Tampa and Orlando.

==Calatrava as sculptor==
Calatrava is also a sculptor and painter, claiming that the practice of architecture combines all the arts into one. In 2003, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City held an exhibition of his artistic and architectural work, entitled Santiago Calatrava: Sculpture Into Architecture. Exhibitions of his work have also taken place in Germany, England, Spain, Italy and elsewhere.

Calatrava's St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church is a redesign for the church destroyed by the collapse of Two World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks.

Calatrava has also submitted designs for a number of notable projects that were eventually awarded to other designers, including the Reichstag in Berlin and the East London River Crossing.

===Unbuilt projects===
*80 South Street was a residential skyscraper, located at that address in New York City's financial district facing the East River. It was composed of ten townhouses in the shape of cubes stacked on top of one another. The townhouses move up a main beam and follow a staggered ladder-like pattern, providing each townhouse with its own roof. The "townhouse in the sky" design was supposed to attract a high-profile clientele willing to pay a hefty US$30 million for each cube. As of 2008, this project had been canceled; the Manhattan real estate market had gone soft, and none of the ten multimillion-dollar townhouses had been sold.

*Chicago Spire was a now-canceled skyscraper in Chicago. Originally commissioned by Chicagoan Christopher Carley, the building site for the project was purchased by Irish developer Garrett Kelleher in July 2006 when Carley's financing plans fell through. Construction of the building was to begin in August 2007, for intended completion in 2011. The Chicago Spire would have been the tallest building in North America. The project was canceled in early 2010. Calatrava Dances onto a New Stage - Business Week 

*Collserola communications tower in Barcelona (1991). A tower shaped like a big white spaceship was proposed, but Norman Foster ultimately designed the tower.
*A bridge in Toronto to the Toronto Island Airport. Locals did not support the airport.

==Criticism==
Calatrava's projects have often been completed late and well over budget, ELPAIS.com – Sólo texto – Calatrava y sus desmanes resulting several times in real or threatened litigation against him. The World Trade Center Transportation Hub in New York is expected to be complete in 2015, six years behind schedule, for a cost of $4 billion, twice what was expected. 

The City of Arts and Sciences complex in his native Valencia ultimately cost around €900 million, almost triple what was originally budgeted, over a 13-year period. Ignacio Blanco, an opposition member of the Valencian provincial parliament for United Left, estimates that the city, financially strapped as a result of country's ongoing economic crisis and unwise spending, still owes €700 million. Blanco started a website, calatravatelaclava.com calatravatelaclava.com (very loosely translated from Spanish as "Calatrava bleeds you dry"), highlighting the architect's propensity for these cost and schedule overruns. Calatrava has been accused of trying to silence his underfunded but vocal Valencian critics by suing them for large monetary damages. Around May 2014, Calatrava won a court ruling requiring that the "insulting and degrading" website name be taken down, although the information on it was judged to be "within the limits of the criticism". Esquerra Unida i Alternativa, the political party behind the website, launched another one called www.calatravanonoscalla.com, loosely translated as "Caltrava will not silence us". 

Some of Calatrava's work has additionally been criticized for impracticality. The metal arches he puts over landscaped gardens, critics say, are beautiful but became too hot in the sunlight for vines to grow around them. In Bilbao, the bridge's glass tiles are prone to break and to become slippery in the local weather, Entre losetas y y arquitectos 'estrellas', El Correo, 24 February 2007. leading The New York Times to dub it "The Bridge of Broken Legs", due to the many accidents that occurred. The compensation payments which followed finally compelled the local administration to add anti-slip treads to its decking, covering the lighting from underneath that was the bridge's selling point. In the City of Arts and Sciences' opera house, 150 seats have partially obstructed views. "ather than searching for functionality or customer satisfaction, he aims for singularity," complains the head of Bilbao's architectural association. " is above and beyond the client." Blanco points to the minimal design notes the architect provides in comparison to his peers. 

Other buildings have been built without essential features. Bilbao Airport lacks an arrivals hall, so a glass wall had to be built to shelter passengers waiting on the street after clearing customs and picking up their bags. Valencia's science museum was originally missing fire escapes or elevators to provide accessibility; they were later added by Calatrava at further public expense. "He was paid even when repairing his own mistakes," Blanco complains. 

Some Calatrava projects have shown visible problems within a few years of completion. It was inevitable, another Valencia architect wrote, that the mosaic Calatrava put on the wall of the City of Arts and Sciences' opera house as a tribute to Antonio Gaudi would buckle as the steel it was affixed to heated up. The city was contemplating a lawsuit against Calatrava and the builders over the wrinkles that have appeared. Tiles on the facade were ripped away by high winds in the winter of 2013-2014. Eventually, the blame was assigned to the contractor responsible for attaching the tiles with adhesive, and repairs are planned. 

A councilor in the Dutch city of Haarlemmermeer called for the city to sue Calatrava over the three bridges he designed over its main canal, which not only cost double their budget but have required far more maintenance than originally anticipated. 

A bridge over the Grand Canal in Venice has multiple problems of Calatrava's projects highlighted by his critics. Starting in 1996, it took 12 years to build and went through numerous structural changes, because of the mechanical instability of the structure and the excessive weight of the bridge, which would cause the banks of the canal to fail. In 10 years the project was inspected by more than eight consultants and the cost had risen to three times the original expectations. , L'Espresso, 8 May 2007. The finished bridge has been criticized for its impractical design; it has many steps embedded in its relatively steep pavement, which makes it uncomfortable to walk on, especially for the elderly. Moreover, it does not have a ramp, so that it cannot be used by wheelchair users. The city has sued Calatrava over both the cost overruns on the original construction and the excessive maintenance costs since then. 

The Domecq Group has sued Calatrava and the building company Ferrovial to pay for the repairs in the cover of the 2001 Ysios winery in Alavan Rioja, Spain. Los "patinazos" de Calatrava, Descubrir el arte, 17 April 2013. The aluminium and cedar cover leaks water, causing humidity inside that is detrimental to wine production. 

Elsewhere in Spain, in 2013 Calatrava and his associates were ordered to pay the city of Oviedo €3.3 million for damages incurred when a convention center collapsed while under construction. The judgment has since been confirmed on appeal, though slightly reduced to just under €3 million. 

"My goal is always to create something exceptional that enhances cities and enriches the lives of the people who live and work in them," Calatrava told the New York Times in response to its article about his projects' many difficulties. He has claimed that his fees for his Valencia work were justified since they included his work as a project manager over 20 years' time, but did not address specific criticisms of its many defects. In an interview with Architectural Record he dismissed criticism there by Blanco and others as politically motivated. He noted that other cities, like Dublin and Dallas, had been satisfied with his work and commissioned projects from him repeatedly. His supporters pointed out that Valencia's government has spent foolishly and extravagantly on other architects' work as well, such as its new airport which remains underused. 

==Exhibits==
A special one-man exhibition of Calatrava's drawings, sculpture, and architectural models was presented at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in March 2006. The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Special Exhibitions: Santiago Calatrava: Sculpture Into Architecture Images from the March 2006 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition. 

==Personal life==
Calatrava's nephew Álex Calatrava is a professional tennis player. Two of Calatrava's sons have completed or are in the process of completing advanced degrees in Engineering from the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science at Columbia University in New York City. His other son has just finished law school at Columbia University.
