[[Nero]]

Nero (; Latin: Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus; In Classical Latin, Nero's name would be inscribed as NERO CLAVDIVS CAESAR AVGVSTVS GERMANICVS. 15 December 37 – 9 June 68) Nero's birth day is listed in Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 6. His death day is uncertain, though, perhaps because Galba was declared emperor before Nero died. The date of 9 June is calculated from Jerome, Chronicle, which lists Nero's rule as 13 years, 7 months and 28 days. Cassius Dio, Roman History LXII.3 and Josephus, War of the Jews IV, say Nero's rule was 13 years, 8 months which would be until 11 June. was Roman Emperor from 54 to 68, and the last in the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Nero was adopted by his great-uncle Claudius to become his heir and successor, and succeeded to the throne in 54 following Claudius' death.

Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade, and enhancing the cultural life of the Empire. He ordered theaters built and promoted athletic games. During his reign, the redoubtable general Corbulo conducted a successful war and negotiated peace with the Parthian Empire. His general Suetonius Paulinus crushed a revolt in Britain. Nero annexed the Bosporan Kingdom to the Empire and began the First Roman–Jewish War.

In 64 AD, most of Rome was destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome, which many Romans believed Nero himself had started in order to clear land for his planned palatial complex, the Domus Aurea. In 68, the rebellion of Vindex in Gaul and later the acclamation of Galba in Hispania drove Nero from the throne. Facing execution as a public enemy, he committed suicide on 9 June 68 (the first Roman emperor to do so). Suetonius states that Nero committed suicide in Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 49; Sulpicius Severus, who possibly used Tacitus' lost fragments as a source, reports that is was uncertain whether Nero committed suicide, Sulpicius Severus, Chronica II.29, also see T.D. Barnes, "The Fragments of Tacitus' Histories", Classical Philology (1977), p. 228. His death ended the Julio-Claudian Dynasty, sparking a brief period of civil wars known as the Year of the Four Emperors. Nero's rule is often associated with tyranny and extravagance. Galba criticized Nero's luxuria, both his public and private excessive spending, during rebellion, Tacitus, Annals I.16; Kragelund, Patrick, "Nero's Luxuria, in Tacitus and in the Octavia", The Classical Quarterly, 2000, pp. 494–515. He is known for many executions, including that of his mother, References to Nero's matricide appear in the Sibylline Oracles 5.490–520, Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales The Monk's Tale, and William Shakespeare's Hamlet 3.ii. and the probable murder by poison of his stepbrother Britannicus.

He is infamously known as the Emperor who "fiddled while Rome burned" Nero was not a fiddle player, but a lyre player (the fiddle was not invented for at least another 1500 years). Suetonius states Nero played the lyre while Rome burned, see Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 38; For a detailed explanation of this transition see M. F. Gyles "Nero Fiddled while Rome Burned", The Classical Journal 42, no. 4 (January 1947), pp. 211–17 – nevertheless, the idea that Nero played any kind of musical instrument is an urban legend, since he was away from Rome at the time of the fire. . and as an early persecutor of Christians. He was known for having captured Christians to burn them in his garden at night for a source of light. This view is based on the writings of Tacitus, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio, the main surviving sources for Nero's reign. Few surviving sources paint Nero in a favorable light. These include Lucan's Civil War, Seneca the Younger's On Mercy and Dio Chrysostom's Discourses along with various Roman coins and inscriptions. Some sources, though, including some mentioned above, portray him as an emperor who was popular with the common Roman people, especially in the East. Tacitus, Histories I.4, I.5, I.13, II.8; Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 57, Life of Otho 7, Life of Vitellius 11; Philostratus II, The Life of Apollonius 5.41; Dio Chrysostom, Discourse XXI, On Beauty. Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources when reporting on Nero's tyrannical acts. On fire and Christian persecution, see F.W. Clayton, "Tacitus and Christian Persecution", The Classical Quarterly, pp. 81–85; B.W. Henderson, Life and Principate of the Emperor Nero, p. 437; On general bias against Nero, see Edward Champlin, Nero, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2003, pp. 36–52 (ISBN 0-674-01192-9 

==Early life==

===Family===

Marcus Domitius Ahenobarbus, the future Nero, was born on 15 December 37 in Antium, near Rome. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 1. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 6. He was the only son of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger, sister of Emperor Caligula.

Nero's father, Gnaeus, was the son of Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 16 BC) and Antonia Major. Gnaeus was thus the grandson of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC) and probably Aemilia Lepida on his father's side, and the grandson of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor on his mother's side. Thus, Nero had as his paternal grandmother Antonia Maior, and also claimed more remote descent from Antonia Minor as a great-grandson—later grandson after Claudius adopted him. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 5. 

Through Octavia, Nero was the grandnephew of Caesar Augustus. Nero's father had been employed as a praetor and was a member of Caligula's staff when the latter traveled to the East (some apparently think Suetonius refers to Augustus' adopted son Gaius Caesar here, but this is not likely). Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 5. 

Nero's father was described by Suetonius as a murderer and a cheat who was charged by Emperor Tiberius with treason, adultery, and incest. Tiberius died, allowing him to escape these charges. Nero's father died of edema ("dropsy") in 39 when Nero was two. 

Nero's mother was Agrippina the Younger, a great-granddaughter of Caesar Augustus and his wife Scribonia through their daughter Julia the Elder and her husband Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. Agrippina's father, Germanicus, was a grandson of Augustus's wife, Livia, on one side and to Mark Antony and Octavia on the other. Germanicus' mother Antonia Minor, was a daughter of Octavia Minor and Mark Antony. Octavia was Augustus' elder sister. Germanicus was also the adopted son of Tiberius. Agrippina poisoned her second husband Passienus Crispus, so many ancient historians also accuse her of murdering her third husband, the emperor Claudius. Tacitus, Annals XII.66; Cassius Dio, Roman History LXI.34; Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Claudius 44; Josephus is less sure, Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XX.8.1. 

===Rise to power===
Coin issued under Claudius celebrating young Nero as the future emperor, c. 50.
Nero was not expected to become Emperor because his maternal uncle, Caligula, had begun his reign at the age of 25 with enough time to produce his own heir. Nero's mother, Agrippina, lost favour with Caligula and was exiled in 39 after her husband's death. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 29. Caligula seized Nero's inheritance and sent him to be raised by his less wealthy aunt, Domitia Lepida, who was the mother of Valeria Messalina, Claudius's third wife. 
Caligula, his wife Caesonia and their infant daughter Julia Drusilla were murdered on 24 January 41. Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.1.14, XIX.2.4. These events led Claudius, Caligula's uncle, to become emperor. Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.3.2. Claudius allowed Agrippina to return from exile. 

Claudius had married twice before marrying Valeria Messalina. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Claudius 26. His previous marriages produced three children including a son, Drusus, who died at a young age. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Claudius 27. He had two children with Messalina – Claudia Octavia (born 40) and Britannicus (born 41). Messalina was executed by Claudius in the year 48. 

In 49 AD, Claudius married a fourth time, to Nero's mother Agrippina, despite her being his niece. To aid Claudius politically, young Nero was adopted in 50 and took the name Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus (see adoption in Rome). Tacitus, Annals XII.25. Nero was older than his stepbrother Britannicus, and thus became heir to the throne. Tacitus, Annals XII.26. 

Nero was proclaimed an adult in 51 at the age of 14. Tacitus, Annals XII.41. He was appointed proconsul, entered and first addressed the Senate, made joint public appearances with Claudius, and was featured in coinage. In 53, he married his stepsister Claudia Octavia. Tacitus, Annals XII.58. 

==Emperor (54–68 AD)==

===Early rule===
Nero and Agrippina. Agrippina crowns her young son Nero with a laurel wreath. She carries a cornucopia, symbol of fortune and plenty, and he wears the armour and cloak of a Roman commander, with a helmet on the ground at his feet. The scene refers to Nero's accession as emperor in 54 AD and is dated before 59 AD when Nero had Agrippina murdered. Information about this sculpture at the Museum of Aphrodisias, Turkey, where it is located. 
An Aureus of Nero and his mother, Agrippina, c. 54.
Claudius died in 54 and Nero, taking the name Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, was established as Emperor. Though accounts vary, many ancient historians state Agrippina poisoned Claudius. According to Pliny the Elder, she used poison mushrooms. On the Mushroom that Deified the Emperor Claudius It is not known how much Nero knew or if he was even involved in the death of Claudius. Cassius Dio's and Suetonius' accounts claim Nero knew of the murder, Cassius Dio, Roman History LXI.35, Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 33; Tacitus' and Josephus' accounts only mention Agrippina, Tacitus, Annals XII.65, Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XX.8.1. 

:Suetonius wrote "... for even if he was not the instigator of the emperor's death, he was at least privy to it, as he openly admitted; for he used afterwards to laud mushrooms, the vehicle in which the poison was administered to Claudius, as "the food of the gods," as the Greek proverb has it. At any rate, after Claudius' death he vented on him every kind of insult, in act and word, charging him now with folly and now with cruelty; for it was a favourite joke of his to say that Claudius had ceased "to play the fool among mortals, lengthening the first syllable of the word morari, and he disregarded many of his decrees and acts as the work of a madman and a dotard. Finally, he neglected to enclose the place where his body was burned except with a low and mean wall." Suetonius • Life of Nero 
Nero became Emperor at 17 when the news of Claudius' death was made known, Book LXI #3 P39 #8 P100 the youngest emperor until that time. Augustus was 35, Tiberius was 56, Caligula was 25 and Claudius was 50. Ancient historians describe Nero's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother, Agrippina, his tutor Lucius Annaeus Seneca, and the Praetorian Prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus, especially in the first year. Cassius Dio claims "At first Agrippina managed for him all the business of the empire", then Seneca and Burrus "took the rule entirely into their own hands,", but "after the death of Britannicus, Seneca and Burrus no longer gave any careful attention to the public business" in 55, Cassius Dio, Roman History LXI.3–7. Other tutors were less often mentioned, such as Alexander of Aegae. 

Very early in Nero's rule, problems arose from competition for influence between Agrippina and Nero's two main advisers, Seneca and Burrus.

In 54, Agrippina tried to sit down next to Nero while he met with an Armenian envoy, but Seneca stopped her and prevented a scandalous scene Tacitus, Annals XIII.5. (as it was unimaginable at that time for a woman to be in the same room as men doing official business). Nero's friends also mistrusted Agrippina and told Nero to beware of his mother. Tacitus, Annals XIII.13. 

Nero was reportedly unsatisfied with his marriage to Octavia and entered into an affair with Claudia Acte, a former slave. Tacitus, Annals XIII.12. In 55, Agrippina attempted to intervene in favor of Octavia and demanded that her son dismiss Acte. Nero, with the support of Seneca, resisted the intervention of his mother in his personal affairs. 

With Agrippina's influence over her son severed, she reportedly began pushing for Britannicus, Nero's stepbrother, to become emperor. Tacitus, Annals XIII.14. Nearly fourteen-year-old Britannicus, heir-designate prior to Nero's adoption, was still legally a minor, but was approaching legal adulthood. According to Tacitus, Agrippina hoped that with her support, Britannicus, being the blood son of Claudius, would be seen as the true heir to the throne by the state over Nero. However, the youth died suddenly and suspiciously on 12 February 55, the very day before his proclamation as an adult had been set. Tacitus, Annals XIII.16. 

Nero claimed that Britannicus died from an epileptic seizure, but ancient historians all claim Britannicus' death came from Nero's poisoning him. Supposedly, he enlisted the services of Locusta, a woman who specialized in the manufacture of poisons. She devised a mixture to kill Britannicus, but after testing it unsuccessfully on a slave, Nero angrily threatened to have her put to death if she did not come up with something usable. Locusta then devised a new concoction that she promised would "kill swifter than a viper." Tacitus, Annals XIII.16; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, XX.8.2; Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 33; Cassius Dio, Roman History LXI.7. 

Her promise was fulfilled after Britannicus consumed it at a dinner party from water used to cool his wine, which had already been tasted, and succumbed within minutes. After the death of Britannicus, Agrippina was accused of slandering Octavia and Nero ordered her out of the imperial residence. Tacitus, Annals XIII.18–21. 

===Matricide and consolidation of power===
Coin of Nero and Poppaea Sabina

Over time, Nero became progressively more powerful, freeing himself of his advisers and eliminating rivals to the throne. In 55, he removed Marcus Antonius Pallas, an ally of Agrippina, from his position in the treasury. Pallas, along with Burrus, was accused of conspiring against the Emperor to bring Faustus Sulla to the throne. Tacitus, Annals XIII.23. Seneca was accused of having relations with Agrippina and embezzlement. Cassius Dio, Roman History LXI.10. Seneca succeeded in having himself, Pallas and Burrus acquitted. According to Cassius Dio, at this time, Seneca and Burrus reduced their role in governing from careful management to mere moderation of Nero. Cassius Dio, Roman History LXI.7. 

In 58, Nero became romantically involved with Poppaea Sabina, the wife of his friend and future emperor Otho. Tacitus, Annals XIII.46. Reportedly because a marriage to Poppaea and a divorce from Octavia did not seem politically feasible with Agrippina alive, Nero ordered the murder of his mother in 59. Tacitus, Annals XIV.1. A number of modern historians find this an unlikely motive as Nero did not marry Poppaea until 62 . Dawson, Alexis, "Whatever Happened to Lady Agrippina?", The Classical Journal, 1969, p. 254. 

Additionally, according to Suetonius, Poppaea did not divorce her husband until after Agrippina's death, making it unlikely that the already married Poppaea would be pressing Nero for marriage. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Otho 3. Some modern historians theorize that Nero's execution of Agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set Rubellius Plautus on the throne. Rogers, Robert, Heirs and Rivals to Nero, Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 86. (1955), p. 202. Silana accuses Agrippina of plotting to bring up Plautus in 55, Tacitus, Annals XIII.19; Silana is recalled from exile after Agrippina's power waned, Tacitus, Annals XIV.12; Plautus is exiled in 60, Tacitus, Annals XIV.22. According to Suetonius, Nero tried to kill his mother through a planned shipwreck, which took the life of her friend, Acerronia Polla, but when Agrippina survived, he had her executed and framed it as a suicide. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 34. The incident is also recorded by Tacitus. Tacitus, "The Annals". 

In 62, Nero's adviser, Burrus, died. Tacitus, Annals XIV.51. Additionally, Seneca was again faced with embezzlement charges. Tacitus, Annals XIV.52. Seneca asked Nero for permission to retire from public affairs. Tacitus, Annals XIV.53. Nero divorced and banished Octavia on grounds of infertility, leaving him free to marry the pregnant Poppaea. Tacitus, Annals XIV.60. After public protests, Nero was forced to allow Octavia to return from exile, but she was executed shortly after her return. Tacitus, Annals XIV.64. 

Nero also was reported to have kicked Poppaea to death in 65 before she could have his second child. Farquhar, Michael (2001). A Treasure of Royal Scandals, p.216. Penguin Books, New York. ISBN 0-7394-2025-9. However, modern historians, noting Suetonius, Tacitus and Cassius Dio's possible bias against Nero and the likelihood that they did not have eyewitness accounts of private events, postulate that Poppaea may have died because of complications of miscarriage or childbirth. Rudich, Vasily, Political Dissidence Under Nero, p. 134. 

Accusations of treason being plotted against Nero and the Senate first appeared in 62. Tacitus, Annals XIV.48. The Senate ruled that Antistius, a praetor, should be put to death for speaking ill of Nero at a party. Later, Nero ordered the exile of Fabricius Veiento who slandered the Senate in a book. Tacitus, Annals XIV.49. Tacitus writes that the roots of the conspiracy led by Gaius Calpurnius Piso began in this year. To consolidate power, Nero executed a number of people in 62 and 63 including his rivals Pallas, Rubellius Plautus and Faustus Sulla. Tacitus, Annals XIV.65. According to Suetonius, Nero "showed neither discrimination nor moderation in putting to death whomsoever he pleased" during this period. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 37. 

Nero's consolidation of power also included a slow usurping of authority from the Senate. In 54, Nero promised to give the Senate powers equivalent to those under Republican rule. Tacitus, Annals XIII.4. By 65, senators complained that they had no power left and this led to the Pisonian conspiracy. Tacitus, Annals XV.51. 

=== Other relationships ===
When Nero's wife Poppaea Sabina died in 65, Nero went into deep mourning. Her body was not cremated, it was stuffed with spices, embalmed and put in the Mausoleum of Augustus. She was given a state funeral. Nero praised her during the funeral eulogy and gave her divine honors. It is said that Nero "burned ten years' worth of Arabia's incense production at her funeral. Donato and Seefried (1989), p. 55. 

In the beginning of 66, he married Statilia Messalina. She was already married when she became Nero's mistress in 65 AD, with Statilia's husband being driven to suicide in 66, so Nero could marry Statilia. She was one of the few of Nero's courtiers who survived the fall of his reign.

In 67, Nero ordered a young freedman, Sporus, to be castrated and then married him. Champlin, 2005, p.145 Ancient History Sourcebook: Suetonius: De Vita Caesarum--Nero, c. 110 C.E. Cassius Dio Roman History: LXII, 28 - LXIII, 12-13 Smith, 1849, p.897 According to Dion Cassius, Sporus bore an uncanny resemblance to Sabina, and Nero even called him by his dead wife's name. 

===Administrative policies===
Coin showing Nero distributing charity to a citizen. c. 64–66.
Over the course of his reign, Nero often made rulings that pleased the lower class. Nero was criticized as being obsessed with personal popularity. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 53; Gibbon, Edward, The History of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Vol. I, Chap. VI. 

Nero began his reign in 54 by promising the Senate more autonomy. In this first year, he forbade others to refer to him with regard to enactments, for which he was praised by the Senate. Tacitus, Annals XIII.25. Nero was known for spending his time visiting brothels and taverns during this period. 

In 55, Nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator. He was consul four times between 55 and 60. During this period, some ancient historians speak fairly well of Nero and contrast it with his later rule. Aurelius Victor mentions Trajan's praise of Nero's first five or so years. Aurelius Victor The Style of Life and the Manners of the Imperitors 5; The unknown author of Epitome de Caesaribus also mentions Trajan's praise of the first five or so years of Nero Auctor incertus Epitome De Caesarbius 5. 

Under Nero, restrictions were put on the amount of bail and fines. Tacitus, Annals XIII.28. Also, fees for lawyers were limited. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 17. There was a discussion in the Senate on the misconduct of the freedmen class, and a strong demand was made that patrons should have the right of revoking freedom. Tacitus, Annals XIII.26. Nero supported the freedmen and ruled that patrons had no such right. Tacitus, Annals XIII.27. 

The Senate tried to pass a law in which the crimes of one slave applied to all slaves within a household. Despite riots from the people, Nero supported the Senate on their measure, and deployed troops to organise the execution of 400 slaves affected by the law. However, he vetoed strong measures against the freedmen affected by the case. Tacitus, Annals XIV.45. 

After tax collectors were accused of being too harsh to the poor, Nero transferred collection authority to lower commissioners. Nero banned any magistrate or procurator from exhibiting public entertainment for fear that the venue was being used as a method to sway the populace. Tacitus, Annals XIII.31. Additionally, there were many impeachments and removals of government officials along with arrests for extortion and corruption. Tacitus, Annals XIII.30, XIV.18, XIV.40, XIV.46. 

When further complaints arose that the poor were being overly taxed, Nero attempted to repeal all indirect taxes. Tacitus, Annals XIII.50. The Senate convinced him this action would bankrupt the public treasury. As a compromise, taxes were cut from 4.5% to 2.5%. Tacitus, Annals XIII.51. Additionally, secret government tax records were ordered to become public. To lower the cost of food imports, merchant ships were declared tax-exempt. 

Nero's abandoned Corinth canal.
In imitation of the Greeks, Nero built a number of gymnasiums and theatres. Tacitus, Annals XIV.20. Enormous gladiatorial shows were also held. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 12. Nero also established the quinquennial Neronia. The festival included games, poetry, and theater. Historians indicate that there was a belief that theatre led to immorality. Others considered that to have performers dressed in Greek clothing was old fashioned. Tacitus, Annals XIV.21. Some questioned the large public expenditure on entertainment. 

In 64, Rome burned. Tacitus, Annals XV.38. Nero enacted a public relief effort as well as significant reconstruction. Tacitus, Annals XV.43. A number of other major construction projects occurred in Nero's late reign. Nero had the marshes of Ostia filled with rubble from the fire. He erected the large Domus Aurea. Tacitus, Annals XV.42. In 67, Nero attempted to have a canal dug at the Isthmus of Corinth. Josephus, War of the Jews III.10.10,Werner, Walter: "The largest ship trackway in ancient times: the Diolkos of the Isthmus of Corinth, Greece, and early attempts to build a canal", The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, Vol. 26, No. 2 (1997), pp. 98–119. Ancient historians state that these projects and others exacerbated the drain on the State's budget. Tacitus, Annals XVI.3. 

The cost to rebuild Rome was immense, requiring funds the state treasury did not have. Nero devalued the Roman currency for the first time in the Empire's history. He reduced the weight of the denarius from 84 per Roman pound to 96 (3.85 grams to 3.35 grams). He also reduced the silver purity from 99.5% to 93.5%—the silver weight dropping from 3.83 grams to 3.4 grams. Furthermore, Nero reduced the weight of the aureus from 40 per Roman pound to 45 (8 grams to 7.2 grams). 

Between 62 and 67, according to Plinius the Elder and Seneca, Nero promoted an expedition to discover the sources of the Nile River. It was the first exploration of equatorial Africa from Europe in history. However, Nero's expedition up the Nile failed because water plants had clogged the river, denying Nero's vessels access to the Sudd of present-day South Sudan.

The economic policy of Nero is a point of debate among scholars. According to ancient historians, Nero's construction projects were overly extravagant and the large number of expenditures under Nero left Italy "thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money" with "the provinces ruined." Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 31. Tacitus, Annals . Modern historians, though, note that the period was riddled with deflation and that it is likely that Nero's spending came in the form of public works projects and charity intended to ease economic troubles. Thornton, Mary Elizabeth Kelly "Nero's New Deal," Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, Vol. 102, (1971), p. 629. 

===Great Fire of Rome (64 AD) ===

The Great Fire of Rome erupted on the night of 18 July to 19 July 64. The fire started at the southeastern end of the Circus Maximus in shops selling flammable goods. 

Artwork depicting the Great Fire of Rome.

The extent of the fire is uncertain. According to Tacitus, who was nine at the time of the fire, it spread quickly and burned for over five days. Tacitus, Annals XV.40; Suetonius says the fire raged for six days and seven nights, Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 38; A pillar set by Domitius states the fire burned for nine days. It destroyed three of fourteen Roman districts and severely damaged seven. The only other historian who lived through the period and mentioned the fire is Pliny the Elder, who wrote about it in passing. Pliny the Elder, Natural Histories, XVII.1.5, Pliny mentions trees that lasted "down to the Emperor Nero's conflagration". Other historians who lived through the period (including Josephus, Dio Chrysostom, Plutarch, and Epictetus) make no mention of it in what remains of their work.
Sketch of Ancient graffiti portrait of Nero found at the Domus Tiberiana.
It is uncertain who or what actually caused the fire—whether accident or arson. Suetonius and Cassius Dio favor Nero as the arsonist, so he could build a palatial complex. Tacitus mentions that Christians confessed to the crime, but it is not known whether these confessions were induced by torture. Tacitus Annals XV.44. However, accidental fires were common in ancient Rome. Juvenal writes that Rome suffered from perpetual fires and falling houses Juvenal, Satires 3.7, 3.195, 3.214. In fact, Rome suffered other large fires in 69 Tacitus, Histories I.2. and in 80. Suetonius, Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Titus 8. 

It was said by Suetonius and Cassius Dio that Nero sang the "Sack of Ilium" in stage costume while the city burned. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero, 38; Cassius Dio, Roman History LXII.16. Popular legend claims that Nero played the fiddle at the time of the fire, an anachronism based merely on the concept of the lyre, a stringed instrument associated with Nero and his performances. (There were no fiddles in 1st-century Rome.) Tacitus's account, however, has Nero in Antium at the time of the fire. Tacitus, Annals XV.39. Tacitus also said that Nero playing his lyre and singing while the city burned was only rumor. 

According to Tacitus, upon hearing news of the fire, Nero returned to Rome to organize a relief effort, which he paid for from his own funds. Nero's contributions to the relief extended to personally taking part in the search for and rescue of victims of the blaze, spending days searching the debris without even his bodyguards. After the fire, Nero opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless, and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors. 

In the wake of the fire, he made a new urban development plan. Houses after the fire were spaced out, built in brick, and faced by porticos on wide roads. Nero also built a new palace complex known as the Domus Aurea in an area cleared by the fire. This included lush artificial landscapes and a 30-meter-tall statue of himself, the Colossus of Nero. The size of this complex is debated (from 100 to 300 acres). Roth, Leland M. (1993). Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History and Meaning, First, Boulder, CO: Westview Press, pp. 227–8. ISBN 0-06-430158-3. Ball, Larry F. (2003). The Domus Aurea and the Roman architectural revolution. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-82251-3. Warden reduces its size to under 100 acre. Warden, P.G., "The Domus Aurea Reconsidered," Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 40 (1981) pp. 271–278. To find the necessary funds for the reconstruction, tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire. Tacitus, Annals XV.45. 

Tacitus, in one of the earliest non-Christian references to the origins of Christianity, notes that the population searched for a scapegoat and rumors held Nero responsible. To deflect blame, Nero targeted Christians. He ordered Christians to be thrown to dogs, while others were crucified and burned. 

===Public performances===
Nero coin, c. 66. Ara Pacis on the reverse.

Nero enjoyed driving a one-horse chariot, singing to the lyre, and poetry. Tacitus, Annals XIV.14, XIV.16. He even composed songs that were performed by other entertainers throughout the empire. Philostratus II, Life of Apollonius 4.39; Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Vitellius 11. At first, Nero only performed for a private audience. Tacitus, Annals XV.33. 

In 64 AD., Nero began singing in public in Neapolis in order to improve his popularity. He also sang at the second quinquennial Neronia in 65. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars Life of Nero 21. It was said that Nero craved the attention, Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 33. but historians also write that Nero was encouraged to sing and perform in public by the Senate, his inner circle and the people. Tacitus, Annals XVI.4; Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Vitellius 11; Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 10, 21. Ancient historians strongly criticize his choice to perform, calling it shameful. Tacitus, Annals XIV.15; Cassius Dio, Roman History LXI.19. 

Nero was persuaded to participate in the Olympic Games of 67 in order to improve relations with Greece and display Roman dominance. Philostratus II, Life of Apollonius 5.7. As a competitor, Nero raced a ten-horse chariot and nearly died after being thrown from it. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 24. He also performed as an actor and a singer. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 25. Though Nero faltered in his racing (in one case, dropping out entirely before the end) and acting competitions, he won these crowns nevertheless and paraded them when he returned to Rome. The victories are attributed to Nero bribing the judges and his status as emperor. Suetonius The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 23, 24. 

===War and peace with Parthia===

Shortly after Nero's accession to the throne in 54, the Roman vassal kingdom of Armenia overthrew their Iberian prince Rhadamistus and he was replaced with the Parthian prince Tiridates. Tacitus, Annals XIII.7. This was seen as a Parthian invasion of Roman territory. There was concern in Rome over how the young Emperor would handle the situation. Tacitus, Annals XIII.8. Nero reacted by immediately sending the military to the region under the command of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. Tacitus, Annals XIII.9. The Parthians temporarily relinquished control of Armenia to Rome. Tacitus, Annals XIII.10. 

The Parthian Empire c. 60. Nero's peace deal with Parthia was a political victory at home and made him beloved in the east.
The peace did not last and full-scale war broke out in 58. The Parthian king Vologases I refused to remove his brother Tiridates from Armenia. Tacitus, Annals XIII.42. The Parthians began a full-scale invasion of the Armenian kingdom. Commander Corbulo responded and repelled most of the Parthian army that same year. Tacitus, Annals XIII.55. Tiridates retreated and Rome again controlled most of Armenia. 

Nero was acclaimed in public for this initial victory. Tacitus, Annals XIII.56. Tigranes, a Cappadocian noble raised in Rome, was installed by Nero as the new ruler of Armenia. Tacitus, Annals XIV.36. Corbulo was appointed governor of Syria as a reward. 

In 62, Tigranes invaded the Parthian province of Adiabene. Tacitus, Annals XV.1. Again, Rome and Parthia were at war and this continued until 63. Parthia began building up for a strike against the Roman province of Syria. Tacitus, Annals XV.4. Corbulo tried to convince Nero to continue the war, but Nero opted for a peace deal instead. Tacitus, Annals XV.16. There was anxiety in Rome about eastern grain supplies and a budget deficit. Tacitus, Annals XV.18. 

The result was a deal where Tiridates again became the Armenian king, but was crowned in Rome by Emperor Nero. Tacitus, Annals XV.29. In the future, the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince, but his appointment required approval from the Romans. Tiridates was forced to come to Rome and partake in ceremonies meant to display Roman dominance. Cassius Dio, Roman History LXIII.2. 

This peace deal of 63 was a considerable victory for Nero politically. Cassius Dio, Roman History LXII.23. Nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the Parthians as well. The peace between Parthia and Rome lasted 50 years until Emperor Trajan of Rome invaded Armenia in 114.

===Other major power struggles and rebellions===
A plaster bust of Nero, Pushkin Museum, Moscow.
The war with Parthia was not Nero's only major war but he was both criticized and praised for an aversion to battle. Suetonius Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 18; Marcus Annaeus Lucanus Pharsalia (Civil War) (c. 65). Like many emperors, Nero faced a number of rebellions and power struggles within the empire.

;British Revolt of 60–61 (Boudica's Uprising)

In 60, a major rebellion broke out in the province of Britannia. Tacitus, Annals XIV.29. While the governor Gaius Suetonius Paullinus and his troops were busy capturing the island of Mona (Anglesey) from the druids, the tribes of the southeast staged a revolt led by queen Boudica of the Iceni. Tacitus, Annals XIV.31. Boudica and her troops destroyed three cities before the army of Paullinus could return, receive reinforcements, and quell the rebellion in 61. Tacitus, Annals XIV.31–38. Fearing Paullinus himself would provoke further rebellion, Nero replaced him with the more passive Publius Petronius Turpilianus. Tacitus, Annals XIV.39. 

;The Pisonian Conspiracy of 65

In 65, Gaius Calpurnius Piso, a Roman statesman, organized a conspiracy against Nero with the help of Subrius Flavus and Sulpicius Asper, a tribune and a centurion of the Praetorian Guard. Tacitus, Annals XV.49. According to Tacitus, many conspirators wished to "rescue the state" from the emperor and restore the Republic. Tacitus, Annals XV.50. The freedman Milichus discovered the conspiracy and reported it to Nero's secretary, Epaphroditos. Tacitus, Annals XV.55. As a result, the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including Lucan, the poet. Tacitus, Annals XV.70. Nero's previous advisor, Seneca was ordered to commit suicide after admitting he discussed the plot with the conspirators. Tacitus, Annals XV.60–62. 

;The First Jewish War of 66–70

In 66, there was a Jewish revolt in Judea stemming from Greek and Jewish religious tension. Josephus, War of the Jews II.13.7. In 67, Nero dispatched Vespasian to restore order. Josephus, War of the Jews III.1.3. This revolt was eventually put down in 70, after Nero's death. Josephus, War of the Jews VI.10.1. This revolt is famous for Romans breaching the walls of Jerusalem and destroying the Second Temple of Jerusalem. Josephus, War of the Jews VII.1.1.

In March 68, Gaius Julius Vindex, the governor of Gallia Lugdunensis, rebelled against Nero's tax policies. Cassius Dio, Roman History LXIII.22. Donahue. Lucius Verginius Rufus, the governor of Germania Superior, was ordered to put down Vindex's rebellion. Cassius Dio, Roman History LXIII.24. In an attempt to gain support from outside his own province, Vindex called upon Servius Sulpicius Galba, the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, to join the rebellion and further, to declare himself emperor in opposition to Nero. Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, Life of Galba 5. 

At the Battle of Vesontio in May 68, Verginius' forces easily defeated those of Vindex and the latter committed suicide. However, after putting down this one rebel, Verginius' legions attempted to proclaim their own commander as Emperor. Verginius refused to act against Nero, but the discontent of the legions of Germany and the continued opposition of Galba in Spain did not bode well for him.

While Nero had retained some control of the situation, support for Galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy. The prefect of the Praetorian Guard, Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus, also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support for Galba.

In response, Nero fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of Ostia and, from there, to take a fleet to one of the still-loyal eastern provinces. According to Suetonius, Nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands, responding with a line from Vergil's Aeneid: "Is it so dreadful a thing then to die?" Nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to Parthia, throwing himself upon the mercy of Galba, or to appeal to the people and beg them to pardon him for his past offences "and if he could not soften their hearts, to entreat them at least to allow him the prefecture of Egypt". Suetonius reports that the text of this speech was later found in Nero's writing desk, but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the Forum. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 47. 

Nero returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace. After sleeping, he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left. Dispatching messages to his friends' palace chambers for them to come, he received no answers. Upon going to their chambers personally, he found them all abandoned. When he called for a gladiator or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him, no one appeared. He cried, "Have I neither friend nor foe?" and ran out as if to throw himself into the Tiber. 

Returning, Nero sought for some place where he could hide and collect his thoughts. An imperial freedman, Phaon, offered his villa, located 4 miles outside the city. Travelling in disguise, Nero and four loyal freedman, Epaphroditos, Phaon, Neophytus, and Sporus, reached the villa, where Nero ordered them to dig a grave for him.

At this time, a courier arrived with a report that the Senate had declared Nero a public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apphrehend him for the act to take place in the Forum. The Senate actually was still reluctant and deliberating on the right course of action as Nero was the last member of the Julio-Claudian Family. Indeed, most of the senators had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the divinified bloodline, if not to Nero himself. The men actually had the goal of returning Nero back to the Senate, where the Senate hoped to work out a compromise with the rebelling governors that would preserve Nero's life, so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced. Tacitus, Annals XV.72. 

Nero, however, did not know this, and at the news brought by the courier, he prepared himself for suicide. Losing his nerve, he first begged for one of his companions to set an example by first killing himself. At last, the sound of approaching horsemen drove Nero to face the end. However, he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary, Epaphroditos, to perform the task. Nero's famous dying words were "Qualis artifex pereo", which translates into English as "What an artist dies in me!" 

When one of the horsemen entered, upon his seeing Nero all but dead he attempted to stop the bleeding in vain. Nero died on 9 June 68, the anniversary of the death of Octavia, and was buried in the Mausoleum of the Domitii Ahenobarbi, in what is now the Villa Borghese (Pincian Hill) area of Rome. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 49. 

With his death, the Julio-Claudian dynasty ended. The Senate, when news of his death reached Rome, posthumously declared Nero a public enemy to appease the coming Galba (The Senate had initially declared Galba as a public enemy) and proclaimed him the new emperor. Chaos would ensue in the year of the Four Emperors. 

===Post mortem===

The alleged Tomb of Nero.
According to Suetonius and Cassius Dio, the people of Rome celebrated the death of Nero. Cassius Dio, Roman History 63. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 57. Tacitus, though, describes a more complicated political environment. Tacitus mentions that Nero's death was welcomed by Senators, nobility and the upper class. Tacitus, Histories I.4. The lower-class, slaves, frequenters of the arena and the theater, and "those who were supported by the famous excesses of Nero", on the other hand, were upset with the news. Members of the military were said to have mixed feelings, as they had allegiance to Nero, but were bribed to overthrow him. Tacitus, Histories I.5. 

Eastern sources, namely Philostratus II and Apollonius of Tyana, mention that Nero's death was mourned as he "restored the liberties of Hellas with a wisdom and moderation quite alien to his character" Philostratus II, The Life of Apollonius 5.41. and that he "held our liberties in his hand and respected them." Letter from Apollonius to Emperor Vespasian, Philostratus II, The Life of Apollonius 5.41. 

Modern scholarship generally holds that, while the Senate and more well-off individuals welcomed Nero's death, the general populace was "loyal to the end and beyond, for Otho and Vitellius both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia." M. T. Griffin, Nero (1984), p. 186; Gibbon, Edward, The History of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Vol. I, Chap. III. 

Nero's name was erased from some monuments, in what Edward Champlin regards as an "outburst of private zeal". Champlin (2003), p. 29. Many portraits of Nero were reworked to represent other figures; according to Eric R. Varner, over fifty such images survive. John Pollini (September 2006), Review of Mutilation and Transformation: Damnatio Memoriae and Roman Imperial Portraiture by Eric R. Varner, The Art Bulletin. This reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously (see damnatio memoriae). Champlin, however, doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of Nero long after his death. Champlin (2003), pp. 29–31. 

Apotheosis of Nero, c. after 68. Artwork portraying Nero rising to divine status after his death.

The civil war during the year of the Four Emperors was described by ancient historians as a troubling period. According to Tacitus, this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline, as Nero and those before him could. Galba began his short reign with the execution of many allies of Nero and possible future enemies. Tacitus, Histories I.6. One such notable enemy included Nymphidius Sabinus, who claimed to be the son of Emperor Caligula. Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Galba 9. 

Otho overthrew Galba. Otho was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of Nero's and resembled him somewhat in temperament. Tacitus, Histories I.13. It was said that the common Roman hailed Otho as Nero himself. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Otho 7. Otho used "Nero" as a surname and reerected many statues to Nero. Vitellius overthrew Otho. Vitellius began his reign with a large funeral for Nero complete with songs written by Nero. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Vitellius 11. 

After Nero's suicide in 68, there was a widespread belief, especially in the eastern provinces, that he was not dead and somehow would return. Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero 57; Tacitus, Histories II.8; Cassius Dio, Roman History LXVI.19. This belief came to be known as the Nero Redivivus Legend.

The legend of Nero's return lasted for hundreds of years after Nero's death. Augustine of Hippo wrote of the legend as a popular belief in 422. Augustine of Hippo, City of God .XX.19.3. 

At least three Nero imposters emerged leading rebellions. The first, who sang and played the cithara or lyre and whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor, appeared in 69 during the reign of Vitellius. Tacitus, Histories II.8. After persuading some to recognize him, he was captured and executed. Sometime during the reign of Titus (79–81), another impostor appeared in Asia and sang to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like Nero but he, too, was killed. Cassius Dio, Roman History LXVI.19. Twenty years after Nero's death, during the reign of Domitian, there was a third pretender. He was supported by the Parthians, who only reluctantly gave him up, Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caears, Life of Nero 57. and the matter almost came to war. 

==Physical appearance==
In his book The Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Suetonius describes Nero as "about the average height, his body marked with spots and malodorous, his hair light blond, his features regular rather than attractive, his eyes blue and somewhat weak, his neck over thick, his belly prominent, and his legs very slender." 

==Historiography==
The history of Nero's reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with Nero. These first histories at one time did exist and were described as biased and fantastical, either overly critical or praising of Nero. Tacitus, Annals I.1; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XX.8.3; Tacitus, Life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola 10; Tacitus, Annals XIII.20. The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events. Tacitus, Annals XIII.20; Tacitus, Annals XIV.2. Nonetheless, these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Nero written by the next generations of historians. Tacitus, Annals XIII.20; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.1.13. A few of the contemporary historians are known by name. Fabius Rusticus, Cluvius Rufus and Pliny the Elder all wrote condemning histories on Nero that are now lost. Tacitus, Annals XIII.20. There were also pro-Nero histories, but it is unknown who wrote them or for what deeds Nero was praised. Tacitus, Annals I.1; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XX.8.3. 

The bulk of what is known of Nero comes from Tacitus, Suetonius and Cassius Dio, who were all of the senatorial class. Tacitus and Suetonius wrote their histories on Nero over fifty years after his death, while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 150 years after Nero's death. These sources contradict on a number of events in Nero's life including the death of Claudius, the death of Agrippina, and the Roman fire of 64, but they are consistent in their condemnation of Nero.

A handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on Nero. Few surviving sources paint Nero in a favorable light. Some sources, though, portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people, especially in the east.

;Cassius Dio
Cassius Dio (c. 155–229) was the son of Cassius Apronianus, a Roman senator. He passed the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus; and afterwards suffect consul around 205, and also proconsul in Africa and Pannonia.

Books 61–63 of Dio's Roman History describe the reign of Nero. Only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by John Xiphilinus, an 11th-century monk.

;Dio Chrysostom
Dio Chrysostom (c. 40–120), a Greek philosopher and historian, wrote the Roman people were very happy with Nero and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely. They longed for his rule once he was gone and embraced imposters when they appeared:

;Epictetus
Epictetus (c. 55–135) was the slave to Nero's scribe Epaphroditos. He makes a few passing negative comments on Nero's character in his work, but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule. He describes Nero as a spoiled, angry, and unhappy man.

;Josephus
The historian Josephus (c. 37–100) accused other historians of slandering Nero.
The historian Josephus (c. 37–100), while calling Nero a tyrant, was also the first to mention bias against Nero. Of other historians, he said:

;Lucan
Though more of a poet than historian, Lucanus (c. 39–65) has one of the kindest accounts of Nero's rule. He writes of peace and prosperity under Nero in contrast to previous war and strife. Ironically, he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrow Nero and was executed. Marcus Annaeus Lucanus, Pharsalia (Civil War) (c. 65). 

;Philostratus
Philostratus II "the Athenian" (c. 172–250) spoke of Nero in the Life of Apollonius Tyana (Books 4–5). Though he has a generally bad or dim view of Nero, he speaks of others' positive reception of Nero in the East.

;Pliny the Elder
The history of Nero by Pliny the Elder (c. 24–79) did not survive. Still, there are several references to Nero in Pliny's Natural Histories. Pliny has one of the worst opinions of Nero and calls him an "enemy of mankind." Pliny the Elder, Natural Histories VII.8.46. 

;Plutarch
Plutarch (c. 46–127) mentions Nero indirectly in his account of the Life of Galba and the Life of Otho. Nero is portrayed as a tyrant, but those that replace him are not described as better.

;Seneca the Younger
It is not surprising that Seneca (c. 4 BEC–65), Nero's teacher and advisor, writes very well of Nero. Seneca the Younger, Apocolocyntosis 4. 

;Suetonius

Suetonius (c. 69–130) was a member of the equestrian order, and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence. While in this position, Suetonius started writing biographies of the emperors, accentuating the anecdotal and sensational aspects.

;Tacitus

The Annals by Tacitus (c. 56–117) is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of Nero, despite being incomplete after the year 66. Tacitus described the rule of the Julio-Claudian emperors as generally unjust. He also thought that existing writing on them was unbalanced:

Tacitus was the son of a procurator, who married into the elite family of Agricola. He entered his political life as a senator after Nero's death and, by Tacitus' own admission, owed much to Nero's rivals. Realizing that this bias may be apparent to others, Tacitus protests that his writing is true. Tacitus, History I.1. 

; Girolamo Cardano
In 1562 Girolamo Cardano published in Basel his Encomium Neronis, which was one of the first historical references of the Modern era to portray Nero in a positive light.

==Nero and religion==

===Jewish tradition===
At the end of 66, conflict broke out between Greeks and Jews in Jerusalem and Caesarea. According to the Talmud, Nero went to Jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions. All the arrows landed in the city. He then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day. The child responded, "I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel" (Ez. 25,14). Nero became terrified, believing that God wanted the Temple in Jerusalem to be destroyed, but would punish the one to carry it out. Nero said, "He desires to lay waste His House and to lay the blame on me," whereupon he fled and converted to Judaism to avoid such retribution. Talmud, tractate Gitin 56a-b Vespasian was then dispatched to put down the rebellion.

The Talmud adds that the sage Reb Meir Baal HaNess, a prominent supporter of the Bar Kokhba rebellion against Roman rule, was a descendant of Nero.

Roman and Greek sources nowhere report Nero's alleged trip to Jerusalem or his alleged conversion to Judaism. Isaac, Benjamin (2004) The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity pp. 440–491. Princeton. There is also no record of Nero having any offspring who survived infancy: his only recorded child, Claudia Augusta, died aged 4 months.

===Christian tradition===
A Christian Dirce, by Henryk Siemiradzki. A Christian woman is martyred in this re-enactment of the myth of Dirce.

Christian tradition and secular historical sources hold Nero as the first major state sponsor of Christian persecution, and sometimes as the killer of Apostles Peter and Paul. Some 2nd- and 3rd-century theologians, among others, recorded their belief that Nero would return from death or exile, usually as "the Anti-Christ. He is also seen as one of the most savage persecutors of Christians."

====First persecutor====
Nero's Torches
Non-Christian historian Tacitus describes Nero extensively torturing and executing Christians after the fire of 64. Suetonius also mentions Nero punishing Christians, though he does so because they are "given to a new and mischievous superstition" and does not connect it with the fire. Suetonius The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Nero, chapter 16. 

Christian writer Tertullian (c. 155–230) was the first to call Nero the first persecutor of Christians. He wrote, "Examine your records. There you will find that Nero was the first that persecuted this doctrine". Tertullian Apologeticum, lost text quoted in , Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, II.25.4. Lactantius (c. 240–320) also said that Nero "first persecuted the servants of God". Lactantius, Of the Manner in Which the Persecutors Died II. as does Sulpicius Severus. Sulpicius Severus, Chronica II.28. However, Suetonius writes that, "since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he Claudius expelled them from Rome" ("Iudaeos impulsore Chresto assidue tumultuantis Roma expulit"). Suetonius The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Claudius 25. These expelled "Jews" may have been early Christians, although Suetonius is not explicit. Nor is the Bible explicit, calling Aquila of Pontus and his wife, Priscilla, both expelled from Italy at the time, "Jews". Acts of the Apostles 18:2. 

====Reputed martyrdoms of Peter and Paul====
The first text to suggest that Nero ordered the execution of an apostle is the apocryphal Ascension of Isaiah, a Christian writing from the 2nd century. It says, the slayer of his mother, who himself (even) this king, will persecute the plant which the Twelve Apostles of the Beloved have planted. Of the Twelve one will be delivered into his hands. Ascension of Isaiah Chapter 4.2. 

Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 275–339) was the first to write explicitly that Paul was beheaded in Rome during the reign of Nero. Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History II.25.5. He states that Nero's persecution led to Peter and Paul's deaths, but that Nero did not give any specific orders. However, several other accounts going back to the first century have Paul surviving his two years in Rome and traveling to Hispania, before facing trial in Rome again prior to his death. In the apocryphal Acts of Paul, in the apocryphal Acts of Peter, in the First Epistle of Clement 5:6, and in The Muratorian Fragment. 

Peter is first said to have been crucified upside-down in Rome during Nero's reign (but not by Nero) in the apocryphal Acts of Peter (c. 200). Apocryphal Acts of Peter. The account ends with Paul still alive and Nero abiding by God's command not to persecute any more Christians.

By the 4th century, a number of writers were stating that Nero killed Peter and Paul. Lactantius wrote that Nero crucified Peter, and slew Paul., Lactantius, Of the Manner in Which the Persecutors Died II; John Chrysostom wrote Nero knew Paul personally and had him killed, John Chrysostom, Concerning Lowliness of Mind 4; Sulpicius Severus says Nero killed Peter and Paul, Sulpicius Severus, Chronica II.28–29. 

====The Antichrist====

The Sibylline Oracles, Book 5 and 8, written in the 2nd century, speak of Nero returning and bringing destruction. Sibylline Oracles 5.361–376, 8.68–72, 8.531–157. Within Christian communities, these writings, along with others, Sulpicius Severus and Victorinus of Pettau also say that Nero is the Antichrist, Sulpicius Severus, Chronica II.28–29; Victorinus of Pettau, Commentary on the Apocalypse 17. fueled the belief that Nero would return as the Antichrist. In 310, Lactantius wrote that Nero suddenly disappeared, and even the burial-place of that noxious wild beast was nowhere to be seen. This has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that, having been conveyed to a distant region, he is still reserved alive; and to him they apply the Sibylline verses. 

In 422, Augustine of Hippo wrote about 2 Thessalonians 2:1–11, where he believed Paul mentioned the coming of the Antichrist. Though he rejects the theory, Augustine mentions that many Christians believed that Nero was the Antichrist or would return as the Antichrist. He wrote, so that in saying, "For the mystery of iniquity doth already work," he alluded to Nero, whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of Antichrist. 

Some modern biblical scholars The Book of Revelation, Catherine A. Cory. Revelation, Alan John Philip Garrow. such as Delbert Hillers (Johns Hopkins University) of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the editors of the Oxford & Harper Collins Study Bibles, contend that the number 666 in the Book of Revelation is a code for Nero, Hillers, Delbert, "Rev. 13, 18 and a scroll from Murabba'at", Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 170 (1963) 65. a view that is also supported in Roman Catholic Biblical commentaries. The New Jerome Biblical Commentary. Ed. Raymond E. Brown, Joseph A. Fitzmyer, and Roland E. Murphy. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1990. 1009. 

The concept of Nero as the Antichrist is often a central belief of Preterist eschatology.
