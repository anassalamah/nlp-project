[[Claisen rearrangement]]

The Claisen rearrangement (not to be confused with the Claisen condensation) is a powerful carbon–carbon bond-forming chemical reaction discovered by Rainer Ludwig Claisen. The heating of an allyl vinyl ether will initiate a reaction|rearrangement] to give a γ,δ-unsaturated carbonyl.

The Claisen rearrangement

Discovered in 1912, the Claisen rearrangement is the first recorded example of a -sigmatropic rearrangement.

==Mechanism==
The Claisen rearrangement is an exothermic (about 84 kJ mol−1), concerted pericyclic reaction which according to the Woodward–Hoffmann rules shows a suprafacial reaction pathway. Crossover experiments eliminate the possibility of the rearrangement occurring via an intermolecular reaction mechanism and are consistent with an intramolecular process, now understood as a -electrocyclic reaction. 

There are substantial solvent effects in the Claisen reactions. More polar solvents tend to accelerate the reaction to a greater extent. Hydrogen-bonding solvents gave the highest rate constants. For example, ethanol/water solvent mixtures give rate constants 10-fold higher than sulfolane. 

Trivalent organoaluminium reagents, such as trimethylaluminium, have been shown to accelerate this reaction. 

==Variations==

===Aromatic Claisen rearrangement===
The aromatic variation of the Claisen rearrangement is the reaction|rearrangement] of an allyl phenyl ether to an intermediate which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho-substituted phenol.

Meta-substitution affects the regioselectivity of the ortho rearrangement. With the meta constituent in the 3rd position, electron withdrawing functional groups, such as bromide, move the side-chain to the right of the ether (71% of products) while electron donating groups, such as methoxy, shift it to the left (69% of products).

If ortho-position is substituted then reaction goes to para position with retention in configuration.

Additionally if an aldehyde or carboxylic acid occupies the substituted position the allyl side-chain displaces the group, releasing it quantitatively as carbon dioxide. 

===Bellus–Claisen rearrangement===
The Bellus–Claisen rearrangement is the reaction of allylic ethers, amines, and thioethers with ketenes to give γ,δ-unsaturated esters, amides, and thioesters.

===Eschenmoser–Claisen rearrangement===
The Eschenmoser–Claisen rearrangement proceeds from an allylic alcohol to a γ,δ-unsaturated amide, and was developed by Albert Eschenmoser in 1964.

===Ireland–Claisen rearrangement===

The Ireland–Claisen rearrangement is the reaction of an allylic acetate with strong base (such as Lithium diisopropylamide) to give a γ,δ-unsaturated carboxylic acid. The actual rearrangement occurs from the enolate of the ester—this is the structural analog of the simple alkene in the original Claisen rearrangement.

=== Johnson–Claisen rearrangement===
The Johnson–Claisen rearrangement is the reaction of an allylic alcohol with an orthoester (e.g. trimethyl orthoformate) to give an ester.

===Photo-Claisen rearrangement===
The photo-Claisen rearrangement is closely related to the photo-Fries rearrangement, proceeding by a similar mechanism. Aryl ethers undergo the photo-Claisen, while the photo-Fries is experiences by aryl esters. IUPAC. Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the "Gold Book"). Compiled by A. D. McNaught and A.

==Hetero-Claisens==

===Aza–Claisen===
An iminium can serve as one of the pi-bonded moieties in the rearrangement.

===Chromium oxidation===

Chromium can oxidize allylic alcohols to alpha-beta unsaturated ketones on the opposite side of the unsaturated bond from the alcohol. This is via a concerted hetero-Claisen reaction, although there are mechanistic differences since the chromium atom has access to d- shell orbitals which allow the reaction under a less constrained set of geometries.

=== Chen–Mapp reaction ===

The Chen–Mapp reaction also known as the -Phosphorimidate Rearrangement or Staudinger–Claisen Reaction installs a phosphite in the place of an alcohol and takes advantage of the Staudinger reduction to convert this to an imine. The subsequent Claisen is driven by the fact that a P=O double bond is more energetically favorable than a P=N double bond.

===Overman rearrangement===

The Overman rearrangement (named after Larry Overman) is a Claisen rearrangement of allylic trichloroacetimidates to allylic trichloroacetamides. Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 6, p.507; Vol. 58, p.4 (Article) 

The Overman rearrangement
Overman rearrangement is applicable to synthesis of vicinol diamino comp from 1,2 vicinal allylic diol.

===Zwitterionic Claisen rearrangement===
Unlike typical Claisen rearrangements which require heating, zwitterionic Claisen rearrangements take place at or below room temperature. The acyl ammonium ions are highly selective for Z-enolates under mild conditions.

==Claisen rearrangement in nature==
The enzyme Chorismate mutase (EC 5.4.99.5) catalyzes the Claisen rearrangement of chorismate ion to prephenate ion, a key intermediate in the shikimic acid pathway (the biosynthetic pathway towards the synthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine).
