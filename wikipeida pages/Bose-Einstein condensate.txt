== Chemical equation for combustion of coal ==

Hi,
Can someone please tell me the full chemical reaction for the burning of coal? And petrol if possible? Thanks! --[[User:Fir0002|Fir0002]] 09:46, September 6, 2005 (UTC)
:Coal is mostly carbon, so the basic reaction is C + O<sub>2</sub> –> CO<sub>2</sub>. But incomplete combustion, and impurities in the coal (tar, sulfur, etc, etc), lead to the occurrence of thousands of other reactions, which is where all the smoke and stink come from. Petrol is mostly octane (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>), so the basic reaction is 2 C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> + 25 O<sub>2</sub> –> 16 CO<sub>2</sub> + 18 H<sub>2</sub>O (I think that adds up!). Again, there's various minor components which produce the smells. Also the odd nitrogen molecule in the air gets caught up in the heat of the moment and burnt to nitrogen dioxide (more smells and pollution) - [[User:MPF|MPF]] 11:46, 6 September 2005 (UTC)
::I think it is incorrect to say petrol ([[gasoline]]) is mostly octane. From that article it states that "The bulk of a typical gasoline consists of hydrocarbons with between 5 and 12 carbon atoms per molecule." and that [[octane rating]] is the term for the combustion properties of gasoline, but it doesn't necessarily mean there is any octane at all in the fuel, because other compounds can have a higher octane rating than [iso]octane. I don't know what the most common distribution of compounds in gasoline is though, and I also failed to find a more detailed distribution for [[diesel]] than is in the article. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] <sup><small>[[User talk:Taxman|Talk]]</sup></small> 18:38, September 6, 2005 (UTC)
:Some of the stink of burning coal (and diesel fuel, too) comes from the combustion of sulfur compounds to produce various sulfur oxides (mostly sulfur dioxide: SO<sub>2</sub>). Sulfur dioxide, in addition to its unpleasant odour, is also a key contributor to [[acid rain]]&mdash;sulfur dioxide combined with atmospheric water vapour (H<sub>2</sub>O) forms [[sulfurous acid]]: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>. Modern coal plants are equipped with scrubbers which absorb SO<sub>2</sub> by reaction with limestone (calcium carbonate: CaCO<sub>3</sub>). Many jurisdictions limit the amount of sulfur permitted in diesel fuel (in most of the United States and Canada, I think the current limit is 500 ppm, and there is a push to reduce that to 50 ppm in some areas.)
:Actually SO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water to form [[sulphuric acid]], H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> which fails as acid rain. [[User:Rmhermen|Rmhermen]] 15:26, September 8, 2005 (UTC)
::Thanks everyone for your help! --[[User:Fir0002|Fir0002]] 12:15, September 7, 2005 (UTC)

== Ozone depletion because of cooling of stratosphere ==

Why would ozone levels be depleted if the stratosphere is cooled? --[[User:Fir0002|Fir0002]] 11:04, September 6, 2005 (UTC)
:The two are not related - ozone depletion is due to catalytic decomposition of the ozone by various human-released pollutants such as [[CFC]]s. - [[User:MPF|MPF]] 11:53, 6 September 2005 (UTC)
Because when the stratosphere cools, clouds of ice crystals can form. The surface of these crystal acts as a catalyst for some of the reactions which lead to destruction of stratospheric ozone. This is why the depletion in the ozone layer is greatest at the poles and during winter. [[User:Physchim62|Physchim62]] 21:42, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

:Depends on your definition of consumable. At 100 degrees, the water certainly wouldn't be very refreshing. Depending on how you store the water bottle, solar heating could take it well above that. I'm assuming you are more worried about chemicals leaching from the plastic? I think all plastics used in water bottles are relatively benign, but if you look on the bottle for the specific type, and look for the heat decomposition of that type, you may find more useful information. Was there something other than that you were worried about? You may also want to look into something akin to a [[desert water bag]] [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&rls=GGLD%2CGGLD%3A2003-37%2CGGLD%3Aen&q=%22desert+water+bag%22] that uses very effective [[evaporative cooling]]. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] <sup><small>[[User talk:Taxman|Talk]]</sup></small> 15:36, September 6, 2005 (UTC)

:: Also effective may be freezing the water before you need it, depending on how long you'll be outside. The water will melt in the heat but remain cool while there is ice left. Note that the bottles must be emptied by at least a few inches before freezing, to prevent them from bursting. {{User:Eequor/Signature/Syllabic}} 17:14, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

:In terms of degredation of the plastic, the two water bottles on my desk are both made of [[Polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET / PETE).

[[User:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] 15:51, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

:: Additionally, "high temperatures" in this case are well over 100°F; PET decomposes around 300°C (572°F). Its [[melting point]] is somewhat lower (255°C, 491°F) &mdash; and of course the bottle would explode well before reaching this point &mdash; so at least temperature should not be a problem.

:::: That's probably due to the quality of the manufacturing process. Some chemical residue may end up in the plastic and leach out over time; PET is fairly permeable (enough so that various pollutants could get into the water as well, if the bottle is not stored in a clean place).

== Banana Peel? ==

Is Banana peel actually especially slippery?

Yes. As the outside of a banana peel (the more yellow side) is actually quite sticky (try rubbing your hand across it - there's a lot of friction there), and the whiter inside has (when still moist) a very low coefficient of [[friction]], when you put your foot on the peel, the friction of the yellow, outer side ensures your foot will stay on the peel, while the slippery inside will ensure you slide across the floor, and usually fall over. 

However, for this to happen, three things need to occur: 1) The peel must have the slippery (inside) side on the floor, and the yellow outer peel facing upwards. 2) The floor the peel is on must be hard and relatively smooth (ie, a polished or tiled floor). 3) The peel must still be moist (ie, not been there for a while.

So yes. A banana peel is especially slippery. [[User:Proto|Proto]]<small>&nbsp;[[User_talk:Proto|t]]&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Proto|c]]</small> 13:08, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

::::Lorm makes a point I hadn't realized properly until I calculated it: In an ECI frame, any point on the Earth's equator is moving eastward at about 1674 km/h. So an eastward plane going 800 km/h (relative to an ECI frame) is actually moving backwards (relative to the Earth) at 874 km/h. So point B catches up to the plane from behind.
::::The westward plane is going 1674 + 800 = 2474 km/h relative to the Earth. So to make the 20037 km trip (half the Earth's equatorial circumference), it takes about 8.1 hours.
::::The "eastward" plane is actually going westwards at 874 km/h, so travels 20037 km in about 22.9 hours, for a difference of 14.8 hours.
::::No, this case is nothing like a real flight. A real plane's speed is relative to the air, which is already spinning at (roughly) the same speed as the Earth. So wind is the important factor. I believe the [[trade wind]]s blow from the east (east-to-west), so the eastward plane will generally be slower than the westward one. -- [[User:DrBob|DrBob]] 17:50, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

== Radioactive decay in molecules ==

When an [[atom]] in a [[molecule]] undergoes [[radioactive decay]], what happens to the molecule? {{User:Eequor/Signature/Syllabic}} 16:30, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

:Well I presume the other atoms in the molecule just float off and probably bond with other atoms/molecules is they are not stable. --[[User:bjwebb|ßjweþþ]] <small>([[User talk:Bjwebb|talk]])</small> 17:51, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

:The charge on the atom would almost instantly change, but the exact effects would depend on the situation. In a metal, this would probably be no big deal as the extra electrons/holes would just flow freely around. In a crystal, you'd probably get something like this: Na<sub>22</sub><sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>-</sup> (sodium chloride) [[beta decay]]s to Ne<sub>22</sub>Cl<sup>-</sup>; the neon, being neutral, would float off freely, leaving a free chloride ion. If the original material was in solution, this would probably alter the [[pH]]. (Note: please feel free to fix my formatting, as I don't yet know how to use the &lt;math&gt; tags. The numbers in parentheses are isotopes, and the +/- show the charge). --[[User:David Wahler|David Wahler]] [[User talk:David Wahler|(talk)]] 20:12, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

:The atom in question will usually escape from whatever molecule it was attached to. When the radioactive decay occurs momentum is conserved&mdash;the atom gets an equal push in the opposite direction when radiation is emitted. The amount of kinetic energy it gets is usually quite large compared to the binding energy that held it in the molecule. What gets left behind is usually going to be an [[ion]] or a [[free radical]] of some sort.
:In nonconducting solid materials, this can result in charge separations: small regions of positive and negative charge that have no easy way of getting back together again. (These little charged regions can behave very differently from their surroundings. Sodium chloride turns pale orange when exposed to ionizing radiation, and fades to gray as the positive and negative charges gradually reunite. Different types of glass can turn brown, green, or violet. [[Potassium bromide]] turns a lovely blue colour.)
:As noted above, electrons in metals slosh around fairly freely, so these charge separations disappear rapidly. [[User:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades]]([[User_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk]]) 12:33, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

== differences and similarities ==

hello!

I am a Year 9 student at Tonbridge grammar school for girls and i am doing a project and i am in need of your help!

i am trying to find out between the differences and similarities between the following:

neon and argon
neon and francium

i would be grateful if you could give me a list of the similarities or point me in the right direction of finding the answers.

thank-you
charlotte

p.s i do not know where to contact you so sorry if this is the wrong email place.

:Hi! If you're not sure where to look, you can start with the articles on each of those substances: [[Neon]], [[Argon]] and [[Francium]].

== motion sickness in games ==

i was playing gta sa and was attacked by motion sickness. is this normal? --[[User:Phil 1970|Phil 1970]] 20:45, 7 September 2005 (UTC)
:Before I continue, I'd like to point you to [[Wikipedia:Medical disclaimer]] - just in case.
:I haven't played that particular game myself, but no, I don't think it is. It might just have been a freak occurence brought on by a number of outside factors, but if you're concerned or it happens again, I suggest you go see a doctor. --[[User:Pidgeot|Pidgeot]] <small>[[User_talk:Pidgeot|(t)]] [[Special:Contributions/Pidgeot|(c)]] [[Special:Emailuser/Pidgeot|(e)]]</small> 20:56, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

:It's not too unusual. Motion sickness generally occurs because of a mismatch between what your eyes are seeing and what movements are detected by your inner ear (you can get the same effect in reverse by, say, reading a book in a moving car). First person shooters are a common culprit (for instance, bits of Half-Life 2 had to be redesigned because they were too nausea-inducing), though I could see GTA:SA giving the same effect. General advice is to play further back from the screen or monitor, so that you can see more of the surroundings (also, don't play in a dark room where all you can see is the screen). And take regular breaks, get up and walk around, etc., and don't play when tired. -- [[User:DrBob|DrBob]] 21:03, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

:I once suffered from this while playing an old 3D game (I think it was [[heretic (computer game)|Heretic]] or [[Hexen]]). I think what caused this was that the 3D perspectgive was wrong. --[[User:R.Koot|R.Koot]] 00:29, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

*A lot of games can trigger migraines for me -- and my symptoms include motion sickness-like symptoms (vertigo, wooziness, slight nausea). The first one I noticed it on was Doom; lots of games that use similar motion can do it. But some games do it with no obvious similarity. Only takes about 5 minutes of play on the worst ones, and I feel like crap for a day. --[[User:Jpgordon|jpgordon]][[User talk:Jpgordon|&#8711;&#8710;&#8711;&#8710;]] 00:54, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

== Technetium and Promethium ==

Note that both of these elements have no stable isotopes even though the ones next to them do.

Also note that if the Rare Earth (Lanthanides) are extended in place of the third period of
the transition elements, Promethium appears right under Technetium. Also note that both 
atomic numbers are prime numbers whereas Manganese is not. Some discussion of if this is 
just coincidence or if there is a story to tell there would be interesting to me.
:I would expect it's mostly coincidence. A proper extension of the rare earth elements pushes everything further right so that Technetium and Promethium do ''not'' align vertically, if I recall correctly.
:That said, it's been a long time since high school chemistry. &mdash; [[User:Lomn|Lomn]] | <small>[[User Talk:Lomn|Talk]] / [[User:Lomn/RfC|RfC]]</small> 21:14, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

I dont' know what you mean by 'proper' A 'proper' arrangement of the elements is just as it is now, with the Rare Earths in
their own group. I am suggesting an 'improper' arrangement, but one which is not random check this out.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table

If you put Lanthanum under Yttrium, Cerium under Zirconium, et al, Promethium is under Technetium. Coincidence? Maybe.
Awfully odd that the two light (relatively) unstable elements line up like that.

== LCD & Plasma ==

I want to know? LCD monitors are dangerous to the eyes?
Robert Ackerman
:They are less damaging than CRTs. But what exactly do you mean by "dangerous"? Is myopia a danger, or are you more concerned about, say, eyeball cancer?--[[User:Inkypaws|inks]] 23:36, 7 September 2005 (UTC)
::The following caution about liquid crystal displays came with my digi camera - if the LCD cover is broken and the liquid leaks out, and gets into your eyes, then "take the '''urgent''' action indicated": "flush the affected eye with clean water for 15 minutes, and seek medical assistance". Also if swallowed, "drink large amounts of water and induce vomiting, then seek medical assistance". Seems a rather unlikely scenario, but clearly the liquid in an LCD is toxic enough to warrant the caution and advice for medical attention - [[User:MPF|MPF]] 00:29, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

My first impression is that if there is even a remote chance of a problem, a company will put warnings up to mitigate
any possible lawsuit.

== ice cubes ==

If I put two clouds of steam together, I end up with one cloud of steam. If I put two cups of water together, I end up with one cup of water. If I put two ice cubes together, I still have two ice cubes. What chemical/physical proces prevents solids from 'melting' together? --[[User:R.Koot|R.Koot]] 00:48, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

:Steam and liquid water ''are'' the same thing. So the question simplifies to:
:*What's the difference between the liquid and solid phases of water?

:The answer is more mathematical than chemical/physical. In the (3D) interior of a ice cube the interactions between the molecules are weaker than in the (2D) surface (proof left up to the reader <tt>:-)</tt>. Oh yes, [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] speaked of the "surface hell".). So, the same forces/interactions that keep the cube solid/coese, keep one cube apart from the other. 

:Err, sorry by my bad [[Engrish|English]], but hope this help. [[User:Mdob|User:Mdob]] | [[User talk:Mdob|Talk]] 01:15, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

::This is basically the central problem of the study of [[adhesive]]s -- namely, what causes molecules to stick together strongly within objects, but not between objects at surfaces, and how can this behavior be changes? --[[User:David Wahler|David Wahler]] [[User_talk:David Wahler|<small>(talk)</small>]] 01:26, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

:::Ice lumps can fuse together easily under pressure - see [[Glacier#Glacial motion]] for details - [[User:MPF|MPF]] 01:30, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

::::Actually, IIRC, the [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] line was: "God abominates the surfaces" [[User:Mdob|User:Mdob]] | [[User talk:Mdob|Talk]] 23:54, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

: In [[liquid]]s and [[gas]]es, the particles have enough freedom of movement to allow other particles to squeeze between them. In solids, the particles are nearly fixed in place and cannot move aside to admit more material. Thus, when two ice cubes are pushed together, the [[water]] [[molecule]]s would have to pass through each other for the ice cubes to move any farther.

: However, a water molecule is surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged [[electron]]s. While the molecules are overall neutrally charged, the electron clouds will encounter each other first, and will repel each other according to the very powerful [[electromagnetic force]]. Only an extreme amount of [[pressure]] &mdash; or the energy involved in a [[chemical reaction]] &mdash; could overcome this repulsive force.

: This doesn't prevent the ice cubes from freezing together ([[hydrogen bond]]ing) or from sticking together by [[vacuum cementation]] ([[Van der Waals force]]; both of these effects are also controlled by electromagnetism), but the water molecules cannot physically move through each other. {{User:Eequor/Signature/Syllabic}} 01:43, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

Just to pick a nit, steam and liquid water are not the same. Steam is a gas. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam
You are probably thinking of mist, which is commonly called steam, but is not scientifically accurate.

:Yeah, but I was thinking about water microdroplets (in [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]: (vapor/vapor d'água) wich I [[Engrish|mistranslated]] to steam). [[User:Mdob|User:Mdob]] | [[User talk:Mdob|Talk]] 23:54, 8 September 2005 (UTC)
::"Just to pick a nit, steam and liquid water are not the same" - actually, wrong. Steam originally (earliest references circa 1000 AD) meant clouds of condensed water droplets, i.e., what was visible above a cooking pot. It is only in relatively recent times (since the industrial revolution) that it has secondarily also come to mean gaseous water above 100° - [[User:MPF|MPF]] 00:10, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

==Question about scripting in Qbasic?==
If you had to write a command to import numerical data from a .txt document, or something else like it, to be used in a qbasic program, how would you do it??

:This assumes you're going to process each number as you read it. If you want to read in everything at once, you'd have to use an array. Whether you'll need a dynamic or a static array depends on the format on the textfile.

::INPUT will input numbers or text but it uses commas a delimiters, if I recall.

== Pauli exclusion principle ==

Why are [[helium-4]] atoms [[boson]]s? {{User:Eequor/Signature/Syllabic}} 02:38, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

:A [[Helium-4]] [[nucleus]] contains 2 [[proton]]s and 2 [[neutron]]s, each of which is a fermion with [[spin (physics)|spin]] of ±½. As a whole, the nucleus will have a total spin of +2, +1, 0, -1 or -2 - in each case an [[integer]], so the nucleus is a [[boson]]. Compare a [[Helium-3]] nucleus, which contains 3 [[nucleon]]s, so the nucleus as a whole will have a total spin of 3/2, ½, -½ or -3/2 - in each case an [[half-integer]], so the nucleus is a [[fermion]]. HTH. Now ask why the [[electron]]s don't matter :) -- [[User:ALoan|ALoan]] [[User_talk:ALoan|(Talk)]] 11:37, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

:: Ah, okay. The electrons don't matter because they have a total spin of 0, correct? Why are the individual protons, neutrons, and electrons able to occupy the same locations in a [[Bose-Einstein condensate]]? {{User:Eequor/Signature/Syllabic}} 14:12, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

::: Well, actually, the electrons do matter. My answer above discussed the nucleus on its own, not the atom as a whole :) The electrons are also fermions, but there are two of them in a neutral Helium atom: together, the electrons will have a total spin of +1, 0, or -1, leaving He-4 a boson, and Helium a fermion (thinking further, given that the number of electrons equals the number of protons in any neutral atom, the number of neutrons is the only important factor: even → boson; odd → fermion).

:::AFAIK, the atoms in a BEC don't end up at the same physical location (if nothing else, [[electrostatic]] forces ought to keep them apart): they are simply in the same [[quantum state]]. 

:::Now we need a proper particle physicist to let us know that I have not just made all this up. I hope I haven't mixed together my
