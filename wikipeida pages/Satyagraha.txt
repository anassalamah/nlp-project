[[Satyagraha]]

Satyagraha (; satyāgraha), loosely translated as "insistence on truth" (satya "truth"; agraha "insistence") or soul force McKay, John P.; Hill, Bennett D.; Buckler, John; Ebrey, Patricia Buckley; Beck, Roger B.; Crowston, Clare Haru; Wiesner-Hanks, Merry E. A History of World Societies: From 1775 to Present . Eighth edition. Volume C – From 1775 to the Present. (2009). Bedford/St. Martin's: Boston/New York. ISBN 978-0-312-68298-9. ISBN 0-312-68298-0. "Meanwhile, Gandhi was searching for a spiritual theory of social action. He studied Hindu and Christian teachings, and gradually developed a weapon for the weak that he called Satyagraha. Gandhi conceived of Satyagraha, loosely translated as "Soul Force," as a means of striving for truth and social justice through love, suffering, and conversion of the oppressor. Its tactic is active nonviolent resistance." (McKay 859). or truth force, is a particular philosophy and practice within the broader overall category generally known as nonviolent resistance or civil resistance. The term satyagraha was coined and developed by Mahatma Gandhi. He deployed satyagraha in the Indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggles in South Africa for Indian rights. Satyagraha theory influenced Nelson Mandela's struggle in South Africa under apartheid, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s and James Bevel's campaigns during the civil rights movement in the United States, and many other social justice and similar movements. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/525247/satyagraha "Gandhi’s satyagraha became a major tool in the Indian struggle against British imperialism and has since been adopted by protest groups in other countries."

Western pacifists have so far proved ineffective because they have thought that war can be resisted by mere propaganda, conscientious objection, and organization for settling disputes."

satyagrahi.

== Origin and meaning of name ==
Gandhi leading Salt Satyagraha, a notable example of Satyagraha

The term originated in a competition in the news-sheet Indian Opinion in South Africa in 1906. It was an adaptation by Gandhi of one of the entries in that competition. "Satyagraha" is a Tatpuruṣa compound of the Sanskrit words satya (meaning "truth") and Agraha ("polite insistence", or "holding firmly to"). For Gandhi, satyagraha went far beyond mere "passive resistance" and became strength in practising non-violent methods. In his words:

In September 1935, a letter to P.K. Rao, Servants of India Society, Gandhi disputed the proposition that his idea of Civil Disobedience was adapted from the writings of Thoreau.

Gandhi described it as follows:

=== Contrast to "passive resistance" ===
Gandhi distinguished between satyagraha and passive resistance in the following letter:

== Satyagraha theory ==

=== Defining success ===
Assessing the extent to which Gandhi's ideas of satyagraha were or were not successful in the Indian independence struggle is a complex task. Judith Brown has suggested that "this is a political strategy and technique which, for its outcomes, depends of historical specificities." Brown, Judith M., "Gandhi and Civil Resistance in India, 1917–47: Key Issues", in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present, Oxford University Press, 2009 p. 57 The view taken by Gandhi differs from the idea that the goal in any conflict is necessarily to defeat the opponent or frustrate the opponent’s objectives, or to meet one’s own objectives despite the efforts of the opponent to obstruct these. In satyagraha, by contrast, these are not the goals. “The Satyagrahi’s object is to convert, not to coerce, the wrong-doer.” Gandhi, M.K. “Requisite Qualifications” Harijan 25 March 1939 Success is defined as cooperating with the opponent to meet a just end that the opponent is unwittingly obstructing. The opponent must be converted, at least as far as to stop obstructing the just end, for this cooperation to take place.

=== Means and ends ===
The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. The means used to obtain an end are wrapped up in and attached to that end. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use unjust means to obtain justice or to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: “They say, 'means are, after all, means'. I would say, 'means are, after all, everything'. As the means so the end...” R. K. Prabhu & U. R. Rao, editors; from section “The Gospel Of Sarvodaya, of the book The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967. 

Gandhi used an example to explain this:

Gandhi rejected the idea that injustice should, or even could, be fought against “by any means necessary” – if you use violent, coercive, unjust means, whatever ends you produce will necessarily embed that injustice. To those who preached violence and called nonviolent actionists cowards, he replied: “I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence....I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should, in a cowardly manner, become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonour....But I believe that nonviolence is infinitely superior to violence, forgiveness is more manly than punishment.” R. K. Prabhu & U. R. Rao, editors; from section “Between Cowardice and Violence,” of the book The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967. 

=== Satyagraha versus Duragraha ===
The essence of Satyagraha is that it seeks to eliminate antagonisms without harming the antagonists themselves, as opposed to violent resistance, which is meant to cause harm to the antagonist. A Satyagrahi therefore does not seek to end or destroy the relationship with the antagonist, but instead seeks to transform or “purify” it to a higher level. A euphemism sometimes used for Satyagraha is that it is a “silent force” or a “soul force” (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous “I Have a Dream” speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a “universal force,” as it essentially “makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe.” Gandhi, M.K. “Some Rules of Satyagraha” Young India (Navajivan) 23 February 1930 (The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi vol. 48, p. 340) 

Gandhi contrasted satyagraha (holding on to truth) with “duragraha” (holding on by force), as in protest meant more to harass than enlighten opponents. He wrote: “There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause.” R. K. Prabhu & U. R. Rao, editors; from section “Power of Satyagraha,” of the book The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967. 

Civil disobedience and non-cooperation as practised under Satyagraha are based on the “law of suffering”, Gandhi, M.K. “The Law of Suffering” Young India 16 June 1920 a doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end. This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, non-cooperation in Satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the cooperation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice.

== Satyagraha in large-scale conflict ==

When using satyagraha in a large-scale political conflict involving civil disobedience, Gandhi believed that the satyagrahis must undergo training to ensure discipline. He wrote that it is “only when people have proved their active loyalty by obeying the many laws of the State that they acquire the right of Civil Disobedience.” 

He therefore made part of the discipline that satyagrahis:
# appreciate the other laws of the State and obey them voluntarily
# tolerate these laws, even when they are inconvenient
# be willing to undergo suffering, loss of property, and to endure the suffering that might be inflicted on family and friends Gandhi, M.K. “Pre-requisites for Satyagraha” Young India 1 August 1925 

This obedience has to be not merely grudging, but extraordinary:

=== Principles for satyagrahis ===
Gandhi envisioned satyagraha as not only a tactic to be used in acute political struggle, but as a universal solvent for injustice and harm. He felt that it was equally applicable to large-scale political struggle and to one-on-one interpersonal conflicts and that it should be taught to everyone. Gandhi, M.K. “The Theory and Practice of Satyagraha” Indian Opinion 1914 

He founded the Sabarmati Ashram to teach satyagraha. He asked satyagrahis to follow the following principles (Yamas described in Yoga Sutra): Gandhi, M.K. Non-violent Resistance (Satyagraha) (1961) p. 37 
# Nonviolence (ahimsa)
# Truth – this includes honesty, but goes beyond it to mean living fully in accord with and in devotion to that which is true
# Non-stealing
# Chastity (brahmacharya) – this includes sexual chastity, but also the subordination of other sensual desires to the primary devotion to truth
# Non-possession (not the same as poverty)
# Body-labor or bread-labor
# Control of the palate
# Fearlessness
# Equal respect for all religions
# Economic strategy such as boycotts (swadeshi)
# Freedom from untouchability

On another occasion, he listed seven rules as “essential for every Satyagrahi in India”: Gandhi, M.K. “Qualifications for Satyagraha” Young India 8 August 1929 
# must have a living faith in God
# must believe in truth and non-violence and have faith in the inherent goodness of human nature which he expects to evoke by suffering in the satyagraha effort
# must be leading a chaste life, and be willing to die or lose all his possessions
# must be a habitual khadi wearer and spinner
# must abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants
# must willingly carry out all the rules of discipline that are issued
# must obey the jail rules unless they are specially devised to hurt his self-respect

=== Rules for satyagraha campaigns ===
Gandhi proposed a series of rules for satyagrahis to follow in a resistance campaign: 
# harbour no anger
# suffer the anger of the opponent
# never retaliate to assaults or punishment; but do not submit, out of fear of punishment or assault, to an order given in anger
# voluntarily submit to arrest or confiscation of your own property
# if you are a trustee of property, defend that property (non-violently) from confiscation with your life
# do not curse or swear
# do not insult the opponent
# neither salute nor insult the flag of your opponent or your opponent’s leaders
# if anyone attempts to insult or assault your opponent, defend your opponent (non-violently) with your life
# as a prisoner, behave courteously and obey prison regulations (except any that are contrary to self-respect)
# as a prisoner, do not ask for special favourable treatment
# as a prisoner, do not fast in an attempt to gain conveniences whose deprivation does not involve any injury to your self-respect
# joyfully obey the orders of the leaders of the civil disobedience action
# do not pick and choose amongst the orders you obey; if you find the action as a whole improper or immoral, sever your connection with the action entirely
# do not make your participation conditional on your comrades taking care of your dependents while you are engaging in the campaign or are in prison; do not expect them to provide such support
# do not become a cause of communal quarrels
# do not take sides in such quarrels, but assist only that party which is demonstrably in the right; in the case of inter-religious conflict, give your life to protect (non-violently) those in danger on either side
# avoid occasions that may give rise to communal quarrels
# do not take part in processions that would wound the religious sensibilities of any community

== Satyagraha and the civil rights movement in the United States ==
Satyagraha theory also influenced many other movements of civil resistance. For example, Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote in his autobiography about Gandhi's influence on his developing ideas regarding the civil rights movement in the United States:

== Satyagraha and the Jewish Holocaust ==
In view of the Nazi persecution of the Jews in Germany, Gandhi offered satyagraha as a method of combating oppression and genocide, stating:

When Gandhi was criticized for these statements, he responded in another article entitled “Some Questions Answered”:

In a similar vein, anticipating a possible attack on India by Japan during World War II, Gandhi recommended satyagraha as a means of national defense (what is now sometimes called "defence by civil resistance" or "social defence"):

Gandhi's combination of renunciation of violence with active acceptance of suffering also received support from Jewish thinkers. Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl and psychologist Bruno Bettelheim, both Holocaust survivors, confirmed Gandhi's experience that individuals who neither submit passively nor retaliate to violence find in themselves a new sense of strength, dignity, and courage. http://books.google.com/books?id=Y6DDuoS9wtoC&pg=PA101&lpg=PA101&dq=%22Frankl%22+%22Gandhi%22+satyagraha&source=bl&ots=MFMiScohrB&sig=NeZlv_n5SShdJAGQhVEhtDe9qog&hl=en&ei=8z6xSrmRMoyysgP3v6zECw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4#v=onepage&q=%22Frankl%22%20%22Gandhi%22%20satyagraha&f=false Gandhi's approach has been compared with Frankl's.
