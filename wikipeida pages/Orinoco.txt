[[Orinoco]]

The Orinoco is one of the longest rivers in South America at 2,140 km. Its drainage basin, sometimes called the Orinoquia, covers 880,000 km2, with 76.3% of it in Venezuela and the remainder in Colombia. The Orinoco and its tributaries are the major transportation system for eastern and interior Venezuela and the llanos of Colombia.

==History==
Map of Lower Orinoco 1897 
The mouth of the Orinoco at the Atlantic Ocean was documented by Columbus on 1 August 1498, during his third voyage. Its source at the Cerro Delgado-Chalbaud, in the Parima range, was not explored by non-indigenous peoples until 1951, 453 years later. The source, on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border, at 1047 m of elevation ( ), was explored in 1951 by a joint Venezuelan-French team.

The Orinoco delta, and tributaries in the eastern llanos such as the Apure and Meta, were explored in the 16th century by German expeditions under Ambrosius Ehinger and his successors. In 1531 Diego de Ordaz, starting at the principal outlet in the delta, the Boca de Navios, sailed up the river to the Meta. Antonio de Berrio sailed down the Casanare to the Meta, and then down the Orinoco and back to Coro.

Alexander von Humboldt explored the basin in 1800, reporting on the pink river dolphins. He published extensively on the river's flora and fauna.

The new age singer Enya made a song, called Orinoco Flow, honoring the Orinoco river.

==Geography==
The course of the Orinoco forms a wide ellipsoidal arc, surrounding the Guiana Shield; it is divided in four stretches of unequal length that roughly correspond to the longitudinal zonation of a typical large river: 
* Upper Orinoco— 242 km long, from its headwaters to the rapids Raudales de Guaharibos, flows through mountainous landscape in a northwesterly direction
* Middle Orinoco— 750 km long, divided into two sectors, the first of which ca. 480 km long has a general westward direction down to the confluence with the Atabapo and Guaviare rivers at San Fernando de Atabapo; the second flows northward, for about 270 km, along the Venezuelan - Colombian border, flanked on both sides by the westernmost granitic upwellings of the Guiana Shield which impede the development of a flood plain, to the Atures rapids near the confluence with the Meta River at Puerto Carreño,
*Lower Orinoco— 959 km long with a well-developed alluvial plain, flows in a northeast direction, from Atures rapids down to Piacoa in front of Barrancas
* Delta Amacuro— 200 km long that empties into the Gulf of Paría and the Atlantic Ocean, a very large delta, some 22500 km2 and 370 km at its widest.

At its mouth, the Orinoco forms a wide delta that branches off into hundreds of rivers and waterways that flow through 41,000 km2 of swampy forests. In the rainy season, the Orinoco can swell to a breadth of 22 km and a depth of 100 m.

Most of the important Venezuelan rivers are tributaries of the Orinoco, the largest being the Caroní, which joins it at Puerto Ordaz, close to the Llovizna Falls. A peculiarity of the Orinoco river system is the Casiquiare canal, which starts as an arm of the Orinoco, and finds its way to the Rio Negro, a tributary of the Amazon, thus forming a 'natural canal' between Orinoco and Amazon.

===Major rivers in the Orinoco Basin===
* Apure: from Venezuela through the east into the Orinoco
* Arauca: from Colombia to Venezuela east into the Orinoco
* Atabapo: from the Guiana Highlands of Venezuela north into the Orinoco
* Caroní: from the Guiana Highlands of Venezuela north into the Orinoco
* Casiquiare canal: in SE Venezuela, a distributary from the Orinoco flowing west to the Negro River, a major affluent to the Amazon
* Caura: from eastern Venezuela (Guiana Highlands) north into the Orinoco
* Guaviare: from Colombia east into the Orinoco
* Inírida: from Colombia southeast into the Guaviare.
* Meta: from Colombia, border with Venezuela east into the Orinoco
* Ventuari: from eastern Venezuela (the Guiana Highlands) southwest into the Orinoco
* Vichada: from Colombia east into the Orinoco

==Ecology==
The boto or Amazon river dolphin and the giant river otter inhabit the Orinoco River system. WWF: Orinoco River Basin, South America. Retrieved 24 May 2014 The Orinoco crocodile is one of the rarest reptiles in the world. Its range in the wild is restricted to the Orinoco River Basin.

More than 1000 fish species have been recorded in the river basin. Among these are species found in brackish or salt water in the Orinoco estuary, but also many restricted to fresh water. By far the largest orders are Characiformes and Siluriformes, which together account for more than half the fresh water species. Hales, J., and P. Petry: Essequibo. Orinoco Delta & Coastal Drainages. Retrieved 24 May 2014. Some of the more famous are the black spot piranha and the cardinal tetra. The latter species, which is important in the aquarium industry, is also found in the Rio Negro, revealing the connection between this river and the Orinoco through the Casiquiare canal. Seriously Fish: Paracheirodon axelrodi, Cardinal Tetra. Retrieved 24 May 2014 

==Economic activity==
The river is navigable for most of its length, and dredging enables ocean ships to go as far as Ciudad Bolívar, at the confluence of the Caroní River, 435 km upstream. River steamers carry cargo as far as Puerto Ayacucho and the Atures Rapids.

===El Florero Iron Mine===
In 1926 a Venezuelan mining inspector found one of the richest iron ore deposits near the Orinoco delta, south of the town of San Felix on a mountain name El Florero. Full-scale mining of the ore deposits began after World War II, by a conglomerate of Venezuelan firms and US steel companies. At the start in the early 1950s, about 10,000 tons of ore-bearing soil was mined per day. "Venezuela's Magnetic Mountain" Popular Mechanics, July 1949 

===Orinoco Tar Sands===
The Orinoco river deposits also contain extensive tar sands in the Orinoco oil belt, which may be a source of future oil production. Forero, Juan (1 June 2006) "For Venezuela, A Treasure In Oil Sludge" New York Times Vol. 155 Issue 53597, pC1-C6 

==Eastern Venezuelan Basin==
Encompassing the states of Anzoategui-Guarico and Monagas states, the Interior Range forms the northern boundary and the Guayana Shield the southern. Prieto, R., Valdes, G., 1992, El Furrial Oil Field, In Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade, 1978-1988, AAPG Memoir 54, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, ISBN0891813330 Maturin forms the eastern subbasin and Guarico the western. The El Furrial oil field was discovered in 1978, producing from late Oligocene shallow marine sandstones in an overthrusted foreland basin. 

==Recreation and sports==
Since 1988, the local government of Ciudad Guayana has conducted a swim race in the rivers Orinoco and Caroní, with up to 1000 competitors. Since 1991, the "Paso a Nado Internacional de los Rios Orinoco-Caroní" has been celebrated every year, on a Sunday close to 19 April. Worldwide, this swim-meet has gained in importance, and it has a large number of competitors.
