[[Songs Without Words]]

Songs Without Words () is a series of short lyrical piano pieces by the Romantic composer Felix Mendelssohn, written between 1829 and 1845.

==Composition and reception==
The eight volumes of Songs Without Words, each consisting of six "songs" (), were written at various points throughout Mendelssohn's life, and were published separately. The piano became increasingly popular in Europe during the early nineteenth century, when it became a standard item in many middle-class households. The pieces are within the grasp of pianists of various abilities and this undoubtedly contributed to their popularity. This great popularity has caused many critics to under-rate their musical value. 

The first volume was published by Novello in London (1832) as Original Melodies for the Pianoforte, but the later volumes used the title Songs Without Words. 

The works were part of the Romantic tradition of writing short lyrical pieces for the piano, although the specific concept of "Song Without Words" was new. Mendelssohn's sister Fanny wrote a number of similar pieces (though not so entitled) and, according to some music historians, she may have helped inspire the concept. The title Song Without Words seems to have been Felix Mendelssohn's own invention. In 1828, Fanny wrote in a letter "My birthday was celebrated very nicely ... Felix has given me a 'song without words' for my album (he has lately written several beautiful ones)." Andrew Porter, Liner notes from Walter Gieseking recording, Angel 35428 

Mendelssohn himself resisted attempts to interpret the Songs too literally, and objected when his friend Marc-André Souchay sought to put words to them to make them literal songs:
What the music I love expresses to me, is not thought too indefinite to put into words, but on the contrary, too definite. (Mendelssohn's own italics) Mendelssohn, (1864): letter to Marc-André Souchay of 15 October 1842 (pp. 271–272) 

Mendelssohn also wrote other Songs Without Words not collected in volumes, and published only in recent years. Furthermore, original drafts exist for many of the 'Songs' many of which differ quite substantially from the eventually published versions. Some of these have now been published in the Urtext edition of Könemann Music (ISBN 3833113413) In 2008, the Italian pianist Roberto Prosseda recorded a collection of Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words for Decca Records totalling 56 , some of them never recorded before.

Other composers who were inspired to produce similar sets of pieces of their own included Charles-Valentin Alkan (the five sets of Chants, each ending with a barcarolle), Anton Rubinstein, Ignaz Moscheles and Edvard Grieg (his 66 Lyric Pieces). Two Songs Without Words (Op. 10) for piano were also written by Mykola Lysenko. Both Alkan and Rubinstein frequently included items from Mendelssohn's Songs in their recitals. Ferruccio Busoni, who considered Mendelssohn "a master of undisputed greatness", turned to the Songs Without Words in the last year of his life for a projected series of recitals in London.

The titles attributed to some of the Songs below were given by Mendelssohn himself. see Todd (2003), 648. Other fanciful titles were given to certain of the pieces by later publishers but have no authority and do not reflect any intention of the composer.

A piece in D major for cello and piano, written by Mendelssohn around 1845, was published for the first time after his death. It was designated opus 109 and entitled "Song Without Words". It is not related to any of the piano pieces. Stratton, Stephen Samuel (1910). Mendelssohn. J.M. Dent Cellist Carlos Prieto called the piece "an exquisite composition, worthy of the finest pieces Mendelssohn ever composed for this genre." Prieto, Carlos, Álvaro Mutis (translated by Elena C. Murray) (2011). The Adventures of a Cello: Revised Edition, with a New Epilogue. University of Texas Press, ISBN 9780292723931 

A piece for piano in E minor by Mendelssohn was published after his death under Op. 117, entitled "" (Album Leaf); a further piece for piano by Mendelssohn was published after his death, without opus number, listed as WoO 10, titled "" (Gondola Song). Some historians believe these to have been intended for another set of Songs Without Words.

==Arrangements==
Mendelssohn made piano duet arrangements of a number of the songs, namely those that became Book V and the first song of Book VI, which he presented to Queen Victoria in 1844. Todd (2003), 474 Mendelssohn was also aware of arrangements of some of the earlier for piano duet by Carl Czerny. Todd, (2003), 355 Many others have made various arrangements of individual songs, including for orchestra, chamber ensemble, or solo instrument with piano accompaniment. One such example is the arrangement of 22 of the songs by Mendelssohn's student, the German violist Friedrich Hermann (1828–1907), for violin and piano. Strings Magazine on Hermann, Naxos catalogue for a recording of the arrangements 

In 1834, Franz Liszt wrote his (Grand Concert Piece on Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words) for 2 pianos. This was based on songs 1–3 of Book I, Op. 19b. Liszt Society Newsletter No. 70, June 1999 Liszt and a student, Mlle. Vial, started to play it in Paris on 9 April 1835 Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, Vol. V, p. 286, Franz Liszt: Catalogue of Works but Liszt became ill during the performance. Ferruccio Busoni planned to play it in London with Egon Petri, but died before the plan could be realised. It was finally first performed in full by Richard and John Contiguglia at the 1984 Holland Liszt Festival in Utrecht. Richard and John Contiguglia, Duo-Pianists 

There are also examples of recordings of transcriptions, for solo instrument and piano accompaniment, of Mendelssohn written for the voice, which have been entitled "Songs Without Words", for instance by Mischa Maisky. No such arrangements were however made, or so titled, by Mendelssohn himself.
