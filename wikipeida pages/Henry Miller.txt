[[Henry Miller]]

Henry Valentine Miller (December 26, 1891 – June 7, 1980) was an American writer. He was known for breaking with existing literary forms, developing a new sort of semi-autobiographical novel that blended character study, social criticism, philosophical reflection, explicit language, sex, surrealist free association and mysticism, always distinctly about and expressive of the real-life Henry Miller and yet also fictional. Mary V. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive: A Biography of Henry Miller, New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991, p 12. His most characteristic works of this kind are Tropic of Cancer (1934), Black Spring (1936), Tropic of Capricorn (1939) and The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy (1949–59), all of which are based on his experiences in New York and Paris, and all of which were banned in the United States until 1961. "Henry Miller's novels censored and banned in US due to their sexually explicitly content," FileRoom.org, 2001. He also wrote travel memoirs and literary criticism, and painted watercolors.

==Early life==
Miller was born to Lutheran German parents, Louise Marie (Neiting) and tailor Heinrich Miller, at their home, 450 East 85th Street in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, New York City. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, pp. 20–22. As a child, he lived for nine years at 662 Driggs Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Jake Mooney, "'Ideal Street' Seeks Eternal Life," The New York Times, May 1, 2009. known at that time (and referred to frequently in his works) as the Fourteenth Ward. In 1900, his family moved to 1063 Decatur Street in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 36. After finishing elementary school, although his family remained in Bushwick, Miller attended Eastern District High School in Williamsburg. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 38. As a young man, he was active with the Socialist Party of America (his "quondam idol" was the black Socialist Hubert Harrison). Introduction from A Hubert Harrison Reader, University Press of New England He attended the City College of New York for one semester. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 42. 

==Career==

===Brooklyn, 1917–30===
Miller married his first wife, Beatrice Sylvas Wickens, in 1917; Frederick Turner, Renegade: Henry Miller and the Making of Tropic of Cancer, New Haven: Yale University Press, 2011, pp. 88, 104. their divorce was granted on December 21, 1923. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 85. Together they had a daughter, Barbara, born in 1919. Robert Ferguson, Henry Miller: A Life, New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1991, p. 60. They lived in an apartment at 244 6th Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 59. At the time, Miller was working at Western Union; he worked there from 1920-24. In March 1922, during a three week vacation, he wrote his first novel, Clipped Wings. It has never been published, and only fragments remain, although parts of it were recycled in other works, such as Tropic of Capricorn. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, pp. 70–73. A study of twelve Western Union messengers, Miller called Clipped Wings "a long book and probably a very bad one." Henry Miller (ed. Antony Fine), Henry Miller: Stories, Essays, Travel Sketches, New York: MJF Books, 1992, p. 5. 

In 1923, while he was still married to Beatrice, Miller met and became enamored of a mysterious dance hall dancer who was born Juliet Edith Smerth but went by the stage name June Mansfield. She was 21 at the time. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, pp. 78-80. They began an affair, and were married on June 1, 1924. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 87. In 1924 Miller quit Western Union in order to dedicate himself to writing completely. Miller later describes this time – his struggles to become a writer, his sexual escapades, failures, friends and philosophy – in his autobiographical trilogy The Rosy Crucifixion.

Miller's second novel, , was written in 1927–28, initially under the guise of a novel written by June. “Moloch, Or, This Gentile World,” Publishers Weekly, September 28, 1992. A rich older admirer of June, Roland Freedman, paid her to write the novel; she would show him pages of Miller's work each week, pretending it was hers. Mary V. Dearborn, “Introduction,” Moloch: or, This Gentile World, New York: Grove Press, 1992, pp. vii–xv. The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller’s death. Moloch is based on Miller’s first marriage, to Beatrice, and his years working as a personnel manager at the Western Union office in Lower Manhattan. Ferguson, Henry Miller: A Life, pp. 156–58. A third novel written around this time, Crazy Cock, also went unpublished until after Miller's death. Initially titled Lovely Lesbians, Crazy Cock (along with his later novel Nexus) told the story of June's close relationship with the artist Marion, who June had renamed Jean Kronski. Kronski lived with Miller and June from 1926 until 1927, when June and Kronski went to Paris together, leaving Miller behind, which upset him greatly. Miller suspected the pair of having a lesbian relationship. While in Paris, June and Kronski did not get along, and June returned to Miller several months later. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, pp. 102-17. Kronski committed suicide around 1930. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 119. 

===Paris, 1930–39===
In 1928, Miller spent several months in Paris with June, a trip which was financed by Freedman. In 1930, Miller moved to Paris unaccompanied. Soon after, he began work on Tropic of Cancer, writing to a friend, "I start tomorrow on the Paris book: First person, uncensored, formless - fuck everything!" Alexander Nazaryan, "Henry Miller, Brooklyn Hater," The New Yorker, May 10, 2013. Although Miller had little or no money the first year in Paris, things began to change with the meeting of Anaïs Nin who, with Hugh Guiler, went on to pay his entire way through the 1930s including the rent for an apartment at 18 Villa Seurat. Nin became his lover and financed the first printing of Tropic of Cancer in 1934 with money from Otto Rank. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 171. She would write extensively in her journals about her relationship with Miller and his wife June; the first volume, covering the years 1931-34, was published in 1966. Late in 1934, June divorced Miller by proxy in Mexico City. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 174. 

In 1931, Miller was employed by the Chicago Tribune Paris edition, thanks to his friend Alfred Perlès who worked there, as a proofreader. Miller took this opportunity to submit some of his own articles under Perlès name, since at that time only the editorial staff were permitted to publish in the paper. This period in Paris was highly creative for Miller, and during this time he also established a significant and influential network of authors circulating around the Villa Seurat. Gifford, James. Ed. The Henry Miller-Herbert Read Letters: 1935–58. Ann Arbor: Roger Jackson Inc., 2007. At that time a young British author, Lawrence Durrell, became a lifelong friend. Miller's correspondence with Durrell was later published in two books. During his Paris period he was also influenced by the French Surrealists.

His works contain detailed accounts of sexual experiences. His first published book, Tropic of Cancer (1934), was published by Obelisk Press in Paris and banned in the United States on the grounds of obscenity. The dust jacket came wrapped with a warning: "Not to be imported into the United States or Great Britain." Arthur Hoyle, "Remember Henry Miller? Censored Then, Forgotten Now," Huffington Post, May 14, 2014. He continued to write novels that were banned; along with Tropic of Cancer, his Black Spring (1936) and Tropic of Capricorn (1939) were smuggled into his native country, building Miller an underground reputation. While the aforementioned novels remained banned in the US for over two decades, in 1939, New Directions published The Cosmological Eye, Miller's first book to be published in America. The collection contained short prose pieces, most of which originally appeared in Black Spring and Max and the White Phagocytes (1938). Arthur Hoyle, The Unknown Henry Miller: A Seeker in Big Sur, New York: Arcade Publishing, 2014, pp. 23, 38-39. 

Miller lived in France until June 1939. Henry Miller, Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch, New York: New Directions, 1957, pp. 1–2. 

===Greece, 1939–40===
In 1939 Durrell, who lived in Corfu, invited Miller to Greece. Miller described the visit in The Colossus of Maroussi (1941), which he considered his best book. One of the first acknowledgments of Henry Miller as a major modern writer was by George Orwell in his 1940 essay "Inside the Whale", where he wrote:
Here in my opinion is the only imaginative prose-writer of the slightest value who has appeared among the English-speaking races for some years past. Even if that is objected to as an overstatement, it will probably be admitted that Miller is a writer out of the ordinary, worth more than a single glance; and after all, he is a completely negative, unconstructive, amoral writer, a mere Jonah, a passive acceptor of evil, a sort of Whitman among the corpses. Orwell, George "Inside the Whale", London: Victor Gollancz Ltd., 1940. 

===California, 1942–80===
In 1940, Miller returned to New York; after a year-long trip around the United States, a journey that would become material for The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, he moved to California in June 1942, initially residing just outside Hollywood in Beverly Glen, before settling in Big Sur in 1944. While Miller was establishing his base in Big Sur, the Tropic books, then still banned in the USA, For details re the ban in the United States, see e.g., Tropic of Cancer (novel)#Legal issues. were being published in France by the Obelisk Press and later the Olympia Press. There they were acquiring a slow and steady notoriety among both Europeans and the various enclaves of American cultural exiles. As a result, the books were frequently smuggled into the States, where they proved to be a major influence on the new Beat Generation of American writers, most notably Jack Kerouac, the only Beat writer Miller truly cared for. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, pp. 286-87. By the time his banned books were published in the 1960s and he was becoming increasingly well-known, Miller was no longer interested in his image as an outlaw writer of smut-filled books; however, he eventually gave up fighting the image. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 279. 

In 1942, shortly before moving to California, Miller began writing Sexus, the first novel in The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, a fictionalized account documenting the six-year period of his life in Brooklyn falling in love with June and struggling to become a writer. Ferguson, Henry Miller: A Life, p. 295. Like several of his other works, the trilogy, completed in 1959, was initially banned in the United States, published only in France and Japan. Frank Getlein, "Henry Miller's Crowded Simple Life," Milwaukee Journal, June 9, 1957. In other works written during his time in California, Miller was widely critical of consumerism in America, as reflected in Sunday After The War (1944) and The Air-Conditioned Nightmare (1945).

In 1944, Miller met and married his third wife, Janina Martha Lepska, a philosophy student who was 30 years his junior. She bore him two children: a son, Tony, and a daughter, Val. Barbara Kraft, "Hanging in LA with Anaïs Nin (and Henry Miller)," LA Observed, January 24, 2012. They divorced in 1952. The following year, he married artist Eve McClure, who was 37 years his junior. They divorced in 1960, and she died in 1966, likely as a result of alcoholism. Ferguson, Henry Miller: A Life, p. 356. In 1961, Miller arranged a reunion in New York with his ex-wife and main subject of The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, June. They hadn't seen each other in nearly three decades. In a letter to Eve, he described his shock at June's "terrible" appearance, as she had by then degenerated both physically and mentally. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 280. 

In February 1963, Miller moved to 444 Ocampo Drive, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California, where he would spend the last 18 years of his life. Ferguson, Henry Miller: A Life, p. 351. In 1967, Miller married his fifth wife, Hoki Tokuda. Carolyn Kellogg, "Henry Miller's last wife, Hoki Tokuda, remembers him, um, fondly?", Los Angeles Times, February 23, 2011. John M. Glionna, "A story only Henry Miller could love", Los Angeles Times, February 22, 2011. In 1968, Miller signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest,” New York Post, January 30, 1968. After his move to Ocampo Drive, he held dinner parties for the artistic and literary figures of the time. His cook and caretaker was a young artist's model named Twinka Thiebaud who later wrote a book about his evening chats. Thiebaud, Twinka. Reflections: Henry Miller. Santa Barbara, CA: Capra Press, 1981. ISBN 0-88496-166-4 Thiebaud's memories of Miller's table talk were published in a rewritten and retitled book in 2011. Thiebaud, Twinka. What Doncha Know? about Henry Miller. Belvedere, CA: Eio Books, 2011. ISBN 978-0-9759255-2-2 During the last four years of his life, Miller held an ongoing correspondence of over 1,500 letters with Brenda Venus, a young Playboy playmate, actress and dancer. A book about their correspondence was published in 1986. Dear, Dear Brenda: The Love Letters of Henry Miller to Brenda Venus. New York: Morrow, 1986. ISBN 0-688-02816-0 

Late in life, Miller filmed with Warren Beatty for his film Reds. He spoke of his remembrances of John Reed and Louise Bryant as part of a series of "witnesses." The film was released eighteen months after Miller's death. Vincent Canby, "Beatty's 'Reds,' With Diane Keaton," New York Times, December 4, 1981. 

===Death===
Miller died of circulatory complications at his home in Pacific Palisades on June 7, 1980, at the age of 88. Alden Whitman, "Henry Miller, 88, Dies in California," The New York Times, June 9, 1980. His body was cremated and his ashes shared between his son Tony and daughter Val. Tony has stated that he ultimately intends to have his own ashes mixed with his father's and scattered in Big Sur. "Playing Ping Pong With Henry Miller," BBC Radio 4, July 25, 2013. 

==US publication of previously banned works==
The publication of Miller's Tropic of Cancer in the United States in 1961 by Grove Press led to a series of obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein, citing Jacobellis v. Ohio (which was decided the same day in 1964), overruled the state court findings of obscenity and declared the book a work of literature; it was one of the notable events in what has come to be known as the sexual revolution. Elmer Gertz, the lawyer who successfully argued the initial case for the novel's publication in Illinois, became a lifelong friend of Miller's; a volume of their correspondence has been published. Following the trial, in 1964–65, other books of Miller's which had also been banned in the US were published by Grove Press: Black Spring, Tropic of Capricorn, Quiet Days in Clichy, Sexus, Plexus and Nexus. Henry Miller, Preface to Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch, New York: New Directions, 1957, p. ix. 

==Watercolors==
In addition to his literary abilities, Miller produced numerous watercolor paintings and wrote books on this field. He was a close friend of the French painter Grégoire Michonze. It is estimated that Miller painted 2,000 watercolors during his life, and that 50 or more major collections of Miller’s paintings exist. The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a selection of Miller's watercolors, as did the Henry Miller Museum of Art in Ōmachi City in Nagano, Japan, before closing in 2001. Miller's daughter Valentine placed some of her father's art for sale in 2005. He was also an amateur pianist. Dearborn, The Happiest Man Alive, p. 291. 

==Legacy==
Miller is considered a "literary innovator" in whose works "actual and imagined experiences became indistinguishable from each other." His books did much to free the discussion of sexual subjects in American writing from both legal and social restrictions. He influenced many writers, including Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, Paul Theroux and Erica Jong.
