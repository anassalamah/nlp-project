The RegEx finder for finding the links in the question text is not working 100%.
Some of the problems are when there are periods at the end of the real wikipedia link (cannot distinguish this from end of sentence period)
Also, have trouble with endings like "_(short story)".
Therefore, sometimes a garbaged link will be added to the links that I am trying to search for in the text files.
To avoid garbage links showing up in the list, I have excluded links found in the question text.
Presumably, most of these are duplicated of question guesses anyway.
